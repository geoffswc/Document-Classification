Bean is like a malevolent Ace Ventura in slow motion. Remember the
cartoon character who went everywhere with the dark rain cloud
hovering over his head? For everyone he meets, Bean is that cloud.
Since so many slapstick heroes are relentlessly cheerful or harmless,
his troublesome streak is sort of welcome.
