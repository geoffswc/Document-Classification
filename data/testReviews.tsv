1790	1	you leave little notes on my pillow    i told you a million times i can t stand little notes on my pillow     we are all out of corn flakes   f   u      it took me three hours to figure out that  f   u     was felix unger          a frustrated oscar madison   walter matthau   running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger   jack lemmon     in the odd couple    the classic neil simon comedy   based on his own stage play   about suicidal felix   lemmon     who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar   matthau   to stay with him in his apartment after felix s wife throws him out and files for divorce    the hook   oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way   while felix is an obsessive compulsive neat freak    the two men   despite their friendship   instantly clash    movies just aren t as delightfully funny as this one is    every line of neil simon s dialogue flows like comedic poetry   and all the actors are just perfect in their performances    lemmon is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix   but it s matthau who shines brightest as oscar   whose world is being invaded and rearranged   mostly against his wishes   the type of character i always enjoy identifying with      and who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti    the best thing about the film   and this is a testament to the quality of the writing   is that it s a comedy with substance    these two men   even while at each other s throats   genuinely care for one another as friends    when they clash   it isn t cartoonish hatred being displayed   but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to co exist    movies nowadays   take grumpy old men for example   just don t have that extra spark there    these days it s just animosity for the sake of comedy    a television series followed   starring jack klugman and tony randall     which i ll admit i ve never seen an episode of in its entirety   and neil simon even scripted the sequel   the odd couple ii   which was released in 1998    neither of them compare to this comic masterpiece though    it s one of the best comedies of all time and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films    
243	0	the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending    watching one of these movies   everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise    when the film ends   there is a moment of confusion   then recollection   then some more confusion   then possibly a second viewing for clarification    this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more    good surprises make movies fun to watch    then there are the bad twists    you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie   i m talking about you reindeer games   or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid    screwed perfectly suits the latter description    what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on    by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs    larry flynt   scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing    whoops    screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments    norm macdonald stars as willard filmore   a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich   old   insidious boss   miss crock   elaine stritch      when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day   willard is convinced by his best friend rusty   dave chapelle   to kidnap crock s beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars    too excited to pay any attention   the hapless losers  plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home    now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends   realizing they can make even more money   decide to stage the fake kidnapping    of course   everything that could go wrong does    the first forty five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment   a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad    but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear    the more idiotic these characters get   the more reckless the script becomes    at one point   i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters     no   you idiot      i m not just talking about willard and rusty   who were extremely annoying   i m also talking about the cops in this film    a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys   headed by murder one s daniel benzali   were just too clueless to forgive    they give real cops bad names    also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days    looking almost identical to his penguin in batman   returns   every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief    he just didn t belong in this movie    macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was   gross out humor is certainly not his forte    if you re a fan of norm macdonald s other chaotic comedy   dirty work   you might actually love this near sequel    otherwise   don t get screwed out of your hard earned money

1229	1	the   submarine   genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is    think about it        these films are completely based in reality   yet only a handful of people have ever been on one   making them fascinating to the general public    they aren t like movies that take place on a plane or a train   as anybody can get on one of those    and they aren t like movies that happen in outer space either   because no one s done any of that stuff yet    when a new one comes out   you don t hear anyone say   ugh   another submarine movie   like people tend to say   ugh   another boxing movie      look at modern movies that involve submarines   das boot   the abyss   the hunt for red october   crimson tide        all are well regarded as top notch entertainment    gladly joining that bunch is u 571   which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u   s   naval submarine during world war ii    we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior   bill paxton      mcconaughey s crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma   a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence    the mission goes horribly wrong however   and as a result   mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew   as well as a captured german   become trapped aboard the u 571 in enemy waters    the first great thing about u 571 is the film s opening sequence    the german crew of u 571 are under attack   which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion    it s tense   exciting and fascinating    and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles    most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away    once the plot gets moving   u 571 gives us action sequence after action sequence   making the audience wonder   ok   now how do they get out of this        the stakes keep raising   much like in executive decision   an excellent action thriller     and even though the audience knows how the film will end   it s a lot of fun getting there    i only have two minor complaints about the entire film    the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence    while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going   which they do     i feel as though it could have been done much quicker   and less conventionally    i mean   did we really have to see the ship s crew at a wedding    because of that   you now know exactly what s going to happen to the groom    my other gripe would be during the film s finale    there s an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president s plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one    i cannot stress this enough        until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect   stick with using models    yes   u 571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you   that couldn t happen     but the overall point of this film is entertainment    it succeeds fantastically     pg 13   
1618	1	a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings    a prime example of this is 1999 s 10 things i hate about you   which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school    less successful was last year s adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp   here the setting was the corporate world of new york    now comes o   a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare s tragedies    like 10 things i hate about you   the stage is a high school   a private prep school where odin james   mekhi phifer   is the on court general   the basketball team s standout player    julia stiles   featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke s hamlet   plays desi brable   odin s girlfriend   whose father also happens to be dean of the institution    josh hartnett   pearl harbor   is on hand for the villainy   playing the scheming hugo   who sets the tragic wheels in motion    o was actually filmed a couple of years ago   but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy    the movie   directed by tim blake nelson   best known for his co starring role in o brother   where art thou      and written by brad kaaya   is very grim    an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits    and that is how it should be    of all of shakespeare s tragedies   othello is the most harrowing   not because of any body count   but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago   whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery    kaaya s profane filled script   after all   these are high school kids   does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts    the young man considers himself the basketball team s prime utility man who does a little bit of everything   pass   shoot   rebound   but is constantly in the shadow of odin    plus his father   the team s coach   played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen   showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood    the script follows the familiar lines of the classic    hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi s fidelity   eroding the star s confidence in those he considers closest to him   affecting both his relationships and his game    it all ends in blood   of course   which is why the movie was originally shelved    the performances in o vary    phifer is at first cocky and self assured   emotions he handles with ease    he also does quite well displaying odin s darker side   his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution   his growing distrust of those he loved   his rage and the erosion of his belief system    hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit   turning friend against friend   and lover against lover    stiles seems a bit stilted   but occasionally also rises to the occasion   moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight    the film does contain a few missteps   a subplot involving hugo s theft of the school mascot is left hanging    also desi s actions concerning michael   andrew keegan     odin s former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo s machinations   is puzzling    why she would continually be seen with michael   however innocent the circumstances   when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back    it is irrational    but these are minor carpings    overall   o is a stylish and faithful adaptation    if nothing else   it may encourage some people to read the original text   and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature    
1582	1	this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven    he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers    all of his movies have one main thing in common  they don t skimp on the violence    in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn t get shot once in the chest  he gets shot many times all over the body    robocop takes place in detroit in the future    things are pretty bleak    the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force    peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner   nancy allen    peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed    meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed 209 model robot crime fighter    someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after    the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace    it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off   but plot twists keep it exciting    the acting is bad from weller when he is human   but very good when he is robocop    nancy allen does a decent job    this movie doesn t leave itself open for a sequel exactly    but they made one anyway    enter        robocop 2 starring   peter weller and nancy allen directed by   irvin kershner  detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film    ocp is trying to develop an improved  robocop 2  that will be more than a match for criminals    most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over   leaving robocop to be the police force in the city    this film is pretty bizaare    it has a 13 year old drug lord who curses as much as eddie murphy   even more violence than the original   and some more humor    the plot of this movie is pretty large   almost too much so    there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don t really match up    the effects are still decent though    this sequel isn t more of the same really   just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals    if you liked the first one   watch this    but be dissapointed    so later comes        robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke  ocp is now owned by a large japanese company    robocop joins a band of rebels to counter attack the evil empire   i mean ocp    the japanese send a cyborg ninja to deal with robocop    among other things        this movie is easier to follow than the last one    which means the plot isn t quite as crowded    this movie isn t anything special though    just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid friendly way    really not reccomended

1093	1	accepting his oscar as producer of this year s best picture winner   saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over    one could almost say the same about his much prized film    rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery   symbolism   ideas and metaphors   complex and literate storytelling   all possessed of an intelligence that invites    even demands    constant scrutiny   an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth    in short   the antithesis of all things hollywood    yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind    ralph fiennes is the title character   an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory   and particularly the memory of love   is the ostensible focus of the film    but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together   we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him    his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld    the same can easily be said for every other character in the film   of which there are too many    juliette binoche s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart    at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her   and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious   disfigured   dying stranger    even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion   however   that it verges on the comical    with so many characters enjoying so little screen time   the film s 160 minutes can be taxing    yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn t help but feel that greatness was in the air    hints of it were everywhere    in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover   in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern day swimmer in the sahara   in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war    there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years    but ultimately the emotional truths writer director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed    in the end   i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron   a haunting bore    bore is perhaps too strong a word    but after drinking in the rich production values   the cup remains only slightly over half full    
1280	1	written by john grisham and robert altman   as al hayes    directed by robert altman  some time ago   a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel    the novel was a summer smash   topping best seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads    the only problem   the novel wasn t very good    it was far more pulp than pulitzer    but the director realized that   no matter how pedestrian the prose   this book really grabbed people   that the author   while not a great writer   was a fantastic storyteller    so he took on the project   convinced he could make something happen on screen    the director    francis ford coppola    the book   of course   was mario puzo s the godfather    the rest   as they say in showbiz   was history    by bringing up the godfather   i don t mean to suggest that robert altman s the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness    but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material    can you get any more questionable than john grisham    depends on whom you ask    but there s no question that grisham s work grabs people    like puzo   grisham is a better storyteller than a writer   unlike fellow hack michael crichton   who is a good idea man but who can t tell a well constructed story from a can of spam    so something in grisham s unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman   who at 73 years old remains one of america s greatest living filmmakers    the result is a gripping thriller that   while falling short of classic cinema   deserves its place in the altman canon     from its opening shot to the closing credits   the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread   with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe    this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch    witness said opening shot   we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing   undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear    we roll over the hills into the town of savannah   then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone    right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises    pay attention   boys and girls   this shot was not conceived by john grisham   but by altman    this is what a great director can do for questionable source material    the sports car belongs to rick magruder   kenneth branagh     the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases    magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office    outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses   mallory doss   embeth davidzt     just as she realizes her car has been stolen    driven by southern chivalry   a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress   magruder offers her a ride home    there he learns more about mallory s life than he bargained for    her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon   robert duvall     a ted kyzynski style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter    magruder   perhaps influenced by mallory s decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him   is sympathetic to her plight   and offers to help her get her father committed   right after he sleeps with her   of course    this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end    he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital   and for a moment all appears well    but then dixon s crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup   and suddenly magruder finds himself   mallory and his own children in danger    the cops won t lift a finger to help a liberal attorney    his only allies are his faithful assistant lois   daryl hannah   and his bumbling private eye sidekick clyde   robert downey jr      if this predicament wasn t bad enough   hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos    altman may provide the atmosphere   but branagh s performance holds the gingerbread man together    an accomplished actor when he isn t directing himself in vanity productions   branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives    is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness   or of egotism    magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it   and by then it s too late    as the plot unfolds   magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are    and life is never so bad that it can t get worse    if you re familiar with altman s work   you ll recognize several of his signature techniques    characters are not introduced in establishing shots   but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent    crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows   making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action    dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style    and of course there s my favorite altman technique   the obligatory nude actress shot    thanks to altman   here are some of the actresses i ve had the pleasure of seeing naked   sally kellerman   julianne moore   madeline stowe   even frances mcdormand    and now i can add embeth davidtz   who looks quite healthy in the altogether    the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film    is it old school sexism   or a clever in joke    you be the judge    but back to the picture at hand    in the hands of a mere mortal   the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller   no better or worse than the countless others we ve all endured    in the hands of a master like altman   it becomes an exercise in existential doom   in its own way far more successful than scorsese s cape fear remake   which tried for the same result    what may prevent it from enduring with altman s greatest work is a weak third act   in fact   there really is no third act in grisham s story   so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up    but there are true moments of riveting suspense   and great performances by branagh   davidzt and downey jr   more than enough to see you through    that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman   and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back   should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are    they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill    and that   my friends   should make you very afraid

of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love    neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful   but both are good enough    and along the way there is one perfect scene   which is one more than you find in most films    slim   played by portly sammo hung   better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies   is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york    when the movie opens   we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver    he does not seem particularly out of place    in fact   he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years   spending most of his life savings in the process   and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water   as he realizes that you can never go home    he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters   cheap sunglasses   and lobsters   which have to be large   to prove they re american     the tokens of his success    he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch   because without eight taels of gold   a man is not a man   my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east   and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb      he loses most of this stuff  except the gold  when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride   so to speak   on a raft along the river which runs past his parents  village    when he arrives unannounced   he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father    all of this has the makings of a routine comedy   and the movie has its amusing moments   as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming   and they all give him birds   so by evening s end he is surrounded by turkeys   ducks   geese and other sundry fowl    but eight taels is not a comedy  it is a sad   sweet story about the choices people make   and how they are sometimes irreparable    director mabel cheung   an autumn s tale   the soong sisters   sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world  what it is like to no longer have a place to call home    slim does not belong in china   nor does he belong in america   where he can barely speak the language    seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village   we come to know the world slim left behind   and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time   and wishes it felt more like home    the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed   i   being one   was sympathetic    on his way to his parent s village   slim hooks up with jenny   sylvia chang     whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds and ends   which is what he continues to call her   although she is now a mature   professional   attractive woman   to be married in the spring to an american chinese man    slim and odds and ends fall for each other    that s predictable    the manner in which their   non    romance is played out is not    the emotions involved are adult and complex   and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma    it s typical   for instance   that the fianc   in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk   because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover    but here the fianc   is a decent   ordinary guy   and although slim would like to feel anger   he cannot    the fianc   has done nothing wrong   the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions   take your pick    eight taels has its share of flaws   the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak     but it compensates with insight    when odds and ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco   she notes resignedly     it s all the same    wherever we go   we ll be in chinatown     and her straightforward statement expresses much    there is insight   too   in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds and ends  decisions   he to move to america   she to marry a chinese american    both their choices were perhaps born of impatience   perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener  and it turns out that both choices were wrong    but they cannot undo them   they must live with what they have done    such is life    the movie is tender toward these people   but it offers no false comforts    everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene   which is the culmination of the love story    slim and odds and ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly   with the muted pop pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them   and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss    the exchange that follows   and what slim then does   is poignant and perfect   with clarity and understatement   we see two people s lives   their heartbreaks and virtues   summed up in a single moment    yes   the film is flawed   but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies    
1877	1	every once in a while   when an exceptional family film comes along   i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been   with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children   it is remarkable how many non disney films disappear in a couple of weeks    now i see that in so doing   i have unfairly ghettoized these films    so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents   but to anyone who wants to support smart   funny   energetic film making   see matilda    see it in a theater   rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video    see the best film i have seen in 1996    not the best children s film       the  best film    period    based on a story by roald dahl   it tells of young matilda wormwood   mara wilson     an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents   harry   danny devito     a crooked used car salesman   and zinnia   rhea perlman     a simple minded bingo addict    the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists   and when they do   it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books    when they finally do send her to school   it is to crunchem hall   a bleak place run by cruel   child hating miss agatha trunchbull   pam ferris      but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher   miss honey   embeth davidtz     who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness    matilda also discovers another special talent    the ability to move things with her mind    which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull s cruelty    it was this spring s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them   and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda    and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton   matilda soars on the cock eyed direction of danny devito    devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses   and he contributes some memorable images    in one scene   an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer   later   an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert    matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale    it is also characteristic of the best children s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don t realize that they are learning them    there is a hilarious moment when matilda s television addicted father snatches away the book she is reading   in a wicked joke   he thinks  moby dick  is pornographic   and forces her to watch an inane game show   hosted by jon lovitz   in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around    matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment   and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child    that because   i m big and you re little   i m right and you re wrong      more specifically   it has as its heroine an intelligent   self confident girl who struggles successfully against other people s notions of how she should behave    it is no coincidence that matilda was co written by robin swicord   who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women    finally   matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment   it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word    devito knows enough to make matilda fast paced and appealing to children   taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy   including a great chase through her dark house    the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable   with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character    but there are also many   many delights for adults   including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda s classmates recite in sing song fashion   there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda s father    i can t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted    matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling    i will see it again   and years from now i will watch it with my children    and now i will stop   because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin   and there is a seat in that theater you should be in   if you have a child or ever were a child    
1466	1	swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults    steven spielberg may not have directed   he only executive produced   but his touch certainly is evident in this movie    and he knows a money making winner when he sees one    the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster   big action   funny comedy   and the pacing of a rollercoaster    hopkins plays don diego de la vega   otherwise known as zorro    a fighter for the people   he is eventually captured by don rafael montero   stuart wilson     who also   unintentionally   kills his wife    the film cuts to twenty years later   where vega still wants to montero dead    however   he s far too old now   and trains up thief alejandro murrieta   banderas   to become the new zorro    banderas motive    to avenge the death of his brother   who was killed at the hands of captain love   matthew letscher   who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar   in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie    with the scene set   the movie goes on full blast   with sword fights a plenty and witty one liners    banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro s   playing each other off with ease    hopkins seems to come off a little better   but banderas does some excellent work    as the bad guys   wilson and letscher seem one dimensional   but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way    the audience does hate them   which can t be bad    catherine zeta jones also pops up as hopkins daughter   and although she provides little more than the usual female lead   she delivers a charming   but one note   performance    the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones    there s a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight   and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed   until jones clothes fall off all together    the director   fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye   1995   handles the film perfectly    the action is well done and fast paced   the comedy put across well    the cast help a lot   but the direction is still outstanding    although the film is very long   the plot keeps chugging along   and there s barely a dull moment    however   the film is a little over indulgent   and it could have been trimmed    it manages to hold the attention   thankfully   and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel    screenwriters john eskow   ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script    although they ve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action   the plot itself is barely existent    there s lots of little sub plots hanging around   but there s nothing substantial to bring them all together    the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to  buy  california using gold stolen from the guy he s buying the land off    this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines    however   this doesn t seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film   so the film is never quite sure where it s going    in the end however   zorro provides action and comedy in spades    it suitable for everyone   so put the guilt behind   and put some more money into spielbergs bank account    you won t regret it

1192	1	good films are hard to find these days    great films are beyond rare    proof of life   russell crowe s one two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller   is one of those rare gems    a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting   an intelligent script   and masterful directing   together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days   genuine motivation in a story that rings true    consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan s character in the film    all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world    i haven t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah s masterpiece   the getaway    but enough with the gossip   let s get to the review    the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman   david morse     an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti government soldiers    upon discovering his identity   the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for  6 million    the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off   and no one will step forward with the money    with no choice available to her   bowman s wife alice   ryan   hires terry thorne   crowe     a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative   to arrange the return of her husband    but when things go wrong    as they always do in these situations    terry and his team   which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year   david caruso   take matters into their own hands    the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character driven vehicle filled with well written dialogue   shades of motivation   and convincing acting by all the actors    the script is based on both a book   the long march to freedom   and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap ransom situations   and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy   screenwriter of the devil s advocate and dolores claiborne    the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan   but that between crowe and david caruso    dug out from b movie hell   caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe s right hand gun while providing most of the film s humor    ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes   david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him   and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic   gunslinger character of terry thorne    the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes    the bulk of those scenes   which bookend the movie   work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story s characters    the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise    director taylor hackford mixes both his old school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film    proof of life is a thinking man s action movie    it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war   and the sacrifices one makes for those choices    the sacrifices that help you sleep at night    
893	0	depending on your degree of cinematic acumen   last man standing is either a   a prohibition era remake of akira kurosawa s 1961 classic yojimbo   b   a prohibition era remake of sergio leone s 1964 classic a fistful of dollars   c   a prohibition era action drama with a completely original story line    new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category   c   than in the other two combined   much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons    the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing   which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the  real  source material   the dashiell hammett novel  red harvest     it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself    this time around   the man with no name is played by bruce willis   a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico    by all appearances   jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town   with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border    one is headed by an irishman named doyle   david patrick kelly     the other is run by chicago connected italian mobster strozzi   ned eisenberg      calling himself john smith   the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict   and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle s side    but smith s allegiance is as uncertain as his name   and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them    viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint   and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes cum bastardizations    there is the happily ineffectual lawman   bruce dern     the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses  affections   karina lombard     the barkeep who becomes our anti hero s only friend   william sanderson     suspicious lieutenants   christopher walken and michael imperioli   to question the bosses  trust in smith   a brutal beating   and a big fire    director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids   including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity   but at least he doesn t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture    what he  does  do is nearly as big a mistake   and that is to provide a running voice over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard boiled style of pulp detective fiction    yes   that narration is full of cliches   but those are are not particularly troubling    the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters    they were a mystery   to the other characters in the film and to the audience   their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted   and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status    with john smith s voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought   he becomes more mundane   just another tough guy trying to stay alive    it feels like a hammett novel   all right   and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice   but it simply doesn t work    the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence   and the man with no name takes  no one  into his confidence    even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate   i can t imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction    willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith   but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else    christopher walken plays doyle s brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft spoken psychos   and there isn t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression    with no compelling antagonist for smith   there is no build up towards the expected showdown   and when it does come   that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about    cinematographer lloyd ahern   who also did the only noteworthy work on hill s 1995 flop wild bill   creates some nifty sunburned vistas   but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter productive narration    sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original   they ll wonder what all the talk was about    in the case of last man standing   it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about

1796	1	   the faculty     the heavily hyped and advertised sci fi horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez   1995 s   desperado   and 1996 s   from dusk till dawn     and screenwriter kevin williamson   1996 s   scream   and 1997 s   scream 2       is being called a cross between   invasion of the body snatchers   and   the breakfast club     and i don t think i could describe it any better than that    the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common   and then the science fiction aspect is added   involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town    the six characters   as in   the breakfast club     can be easily labeled as a stereotype   but as they are developed   they become far more complex   casey   elijah wood     the much picked upon nerd   stokely   clea duvall     a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her   zeke   josh hartnett     a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz   stan   shawn hatosy     the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics   delilah   jordanna brewster     the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist   and marybeth   laura harris     the sweet  n southern new girl in town    although the characters are only slightly connected   i   e    casey is delilah s photojournalist assistant   marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely   since they both don t have friends   etc       when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences   the only people they can count on for help is each other   even though they aren t really even sure if they can trust one another       the faculty   is another smart and pop culturally hip film from williamson   although it does not equal up to his best film   the original   scream     and rodriguez   whose   from dusk till dawn   is still one of the more original genre films of the 90 s    williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions   respectively   that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no brainer    the plotline of   the faculty     involving aliens taking over other people s bodies   has been done quite a lot before   from   invasion of the body snatchers     to   the puppet masters     to   invaders from mars     so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh   and by setting the goings on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens   they were mostly successful    surely   the conventions of the story are still the same   and the climax was inevitable   but there were a few surprises along the way   including the question of who were the aliens   and who weren t    the epilogue was also a refreshing change of pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better    the performances in   the faculty   were a treat throughout   since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do    one exception were the teens   who   aside from elijah wood   are not very well known   but they all aquit themselves nicely   particularly wood   the seasoned pro     clea duvall   and jordanna brewster    as members of the faculty   robert patrick     t2   judgement day     was creepy as the gym coach   piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher   bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien   and salma hayek   as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold   was very funny in a small role    the standout   in my opinion   of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who   after turning into an alien   becomes the sex bombshell    if there was any problem i had with the faculty   it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence    since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the   queen   alien   many of the faculty members disappear    it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers   although the finale is still pretty impressive   and includes some showstopping creature effects   especially for a relatively low 15 million dollar budget    although not one of the best horror or science fiction films i have seen     the faculty   is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released    while the story is as old as the hills   it is also   in a way   timeless   because everyone   i think   has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right   as if they really weren t human    and by putting this idea in the setting of a small town high school   it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers      note   the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading   as it features r   b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters    in actuality   he only has a small role as one of stan s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team    if i were one of the heads from dimension   i would change this advertising at once   since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving    
1769	1	is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all time    it s quite possible    his career spanned over 40 years   and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could    yet   when he is talked about in the media   he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role   the nice guy    and that s really a shame       the naked spur   features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him    it s a western   which stewart specialized in around this period   and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend    before he finds that man   though   he runs into two men who agree to help him   thinking he is a sheriff    when the criminal is eventually caught   the two men discover stewart s secret   and decide they want a piece of the action too    the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly    also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal   well played by janet leigh    we re never too sure who s side she s really on until the end    leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the   shower lady   from   psycho     and that s unfair    she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men    stewart gives a performance unlike anything i ve ever seen from him    he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs   but here   he gets downright hysterical at times    i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a   nice guy      his performance borders on psychotic at times   but i loved watching every second of it    it s roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do    he was an actor unafraid to take chances   and even ruin his public image    
232	0	according to popular film opinion   a film s greatness is determined by time    take for example   casablanca      great film   even today    it s still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic    another example would be   star wars     which had a very   very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before    but as i rewatched   independence day   when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996   i kinda felt like it wasn t as cool as when i had first seen it    i had liked it when i saw it the first time         was my original view   and basically saw it as a good   escape film      but when i rewatched it   i felt cheated    thus   the curse of the   event film         independence day   is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once   except for a couple kids   the critics   in this situation      but after a while   this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one    well   this kid is the   event film   in my little analogy    and when i rewatched   independence day     not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen   but i felt insulted the whole time    there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren t sure if it s comedy or hokey drama    one scene   you ll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch   the next you ll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around   saying corny lines    the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of   glen or glenda      now this annoying kid s problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once   he shows he has no balls    and   independence day   has no balls    it plays it safe everywhere    it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films    the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of   star wars      i mean   isn t that devil s den    and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore s breasts in   striptease      they re these octopus men   boring freaking octopus men    i mean   come on    the aliens in   2001   were more interesting and you didn t even see them    basically the plot is straight from a b movie from the 50s   aliens come to earth and we wonder if they re hostile or peaceful    okay   it s an interesting topic   but it s not handled greatly    now they aren t and somehow a computer geek   jeff goldblum   figure out they re using our satellites as a countdown to destruction    yep    these aliens are not only heavily armed   they re stupid too    they also use the same kind of computer as we do   but that comes about later    the president   bill pullman     who s under attack for being a wimp   decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent   and he decides he ll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered    i don t care if it s bob freaking dole in the white house   get him out of there    i don t care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol   just get him out of there    later on   he s stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship    i think it s time for impeachment for this guy    he s more senile than reagan on pot    then there s a cocky pilot   will smith   who is the only person to survive the counter attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51   the film s only sign of being brave      his girlfriend s a stripper sharing a subplot with   striptease   in that she has to do it for her son    come on   she has a fighter pilot boyfriend soon to be fiance    i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers    she s also the few   the proud   the lucky to survive the igniting of l   a     as well as her dog   who narrowly survives      there are some bright spots    they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing    the best one is when jeff goldblum   nicely named david   turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says     good morning   dave      and they even played r   e   m    s     it s the end of the world as we know it   and i feel fine   at the beginning    and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great   he s a stereotype   but i just loved the man anyway      but there are no real subtle comic moments    will gets way too many one liners and he has no one to play off of   execept jeff towards the end   and the two do great      as i said   this film has no balls    it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that s what it is    but after a couple months   we all move on to the next   event   film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure    but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime    this one s short on batteries    
753	0	a few months before the release of star wars episode 1   the phantom menace   20th century fox decides to release another space film   that is a complete rip off of star wars    what is the point of this    i do not know   but i wish it hadn t been done   considering wing commander is definitely the year s worst film so far    to attract people to this horrible movie   they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace    wing commander will draw large crowds   because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time    the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight    many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game    i found this very interesting   considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie    it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though    freddie prinze jr   stars in the film as christopher blair    wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie    this was definitely his worst performance to date    after january s she s all that   i actually saw a good actor in freddie   but now all those visions have been crushed       for now anyway      christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi   a group that is trying to destroy the earth    blair s parents also fought in the space battles   and also died there    his parents were pilgrims   so many people disrespect him because of this    blair is under the command of   angel     played by saffron burrows   and he is friends with another pilot   todd   maniac marshall     played by matthew lillard    matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie   and he does in this one too    his character as stu in 1996 s scream   a      was a great one   but now   it seems like that same role is being played again   only in a space movie    the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth    this plot is very flimsy   and doesn t give a whole lot to work with at all    this explains why wing commander drags on   seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on    the acting is horrible in wing commander    many lines seem out of place   and are completely meaningless    the acting and dialogue was so terrible   i even found myself laughing at it    the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music    the special effects are very unrealistic    when looking at two ships flying side by side   it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them    the explosions look very unrealistic as well    a ship will be blown up   but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second    this is very unrealistic    music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time    the music also felt like video game music   and it was very corny and annoying sounding    after we are given the plot   the film repeats itself for another hour   without any plot twists   interesting scenes   or anything important to the film    blair is forced to make jumps over other planets   and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft    for the entire length of the movie   it takes place in space    it is truly like you are in a video game   because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long   extended period of time    it s not much fun to watch at all    if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships   i would go watch star wars at home    at least star wars pays attention to people   myth   feelings   and has some real plot to it    the bottom line  bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox    
873	0	paul verhoeven   the dutch auteur who dragged his violent   sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film   has never been what i d consider a thoughtful director   though some of his films   notably starship troopers   have been lauded as artistic achievements     but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who s managed to   no matter what the budget   make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils    starship troopers was essentially a b monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange   a great film that s nearly impossible to find on video   yet showgirls is everywhere     in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins   the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards   who may actually be 45  silicone     in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage    it s not a completely successful film   but as a failure it s certainly an interesting   and mostly entertaining   one    my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores   spetters   a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange   haven t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight      i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop   a bleak super hero satire with a robotic hero that s as touching as schwarzenegger s in t2    that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics    its violence seemed to be there for a purpose   namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread   not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience    there s a jaw dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him    he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim s every fearful tic    it s a startling moment of barbaric   maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk noir    in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won t shut up   he impales a co worker   drowns another and so on    but why    his character is introduced as a smug genius   the kind who s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear   sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place   though once the character becomes invisible   this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster    the kind who just won t die    hollow man s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda   elizabeth shue   acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm   and her lover   a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who s saddled with the film s worst lines     i ve lost cohesion again          they re a typical aaron spelling couple   good looking but as vacant as george w   bush s republican national convention speech   i   e    bush referring to clinton           so much promise       but to what end    to what end         this actually got applause    suddenly warren beatty doesn t look so absurd      the rest of the film s characters are all well past thirty   though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one liners   is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood s new character developing technique    ahh   what a cynical time we live in        as the picture opens we meet cain   kevin bacon     an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret   so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation s   project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility   for what purpose is never hinted at      they ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine   in a twist worthy of the film s 1950 s late show origins   to impulsively experiment on himself    caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead    our mad scientist is turned invisible   after several fx heavy complications     then he inexplicably   it s hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures   but this is never explored   and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human      begins raping   assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases   always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger    it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it s verhoeven s films that have become hollow    like the rest   this one is cold   heartless   and full of contempt for humanity   but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit   insight and makes no statement other than   audiences will pay for anything these days      it s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level   or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun   thrill a minute ride    verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care    the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick    how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self    a couple weeks ago   after seeing the trailer   a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability    hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa   in a serious manner to boot    but oh yeah   it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway    verhoeven delivers the sleazy   goods     but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner   here it just feels icky and uncomfortable    the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses   caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux psycho music strains in the background    it s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn t exploring voyeurism   like in the classic peeping tom   but exploiting it and not even doing that very well    it s funny that with all the technology  90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand    most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks    in fact it s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since   by the end   most of his potential victims don infer red glasses that track his body heat    as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov   a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre     and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked    the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy    it happens when a lab assistant   kim dickens   who looks like she stepped out of playboy   in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon   suddenly pauses       are you looking at me       she queries   obviously haunted    it s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982   the apex of the mad slasher craze      those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer    and they re the only reason to check out hollow man   preferably as a mid week bargain rental    you ve been warned    but you probably won t listen   will you    tis  a pity        
299	0	this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont s debut as a director   1994 surprise hit speed    but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead    annie   sandra bullock   is in the wrong place at the wrong time again    she s going on a cruise with her new boy friend alex   jason patric     and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger   willem dafoe   who has a bone to pick with the shipping line    they sacked him after he got sick    now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship s safe for compensation    that actually is the whole storyline    speed 2 could do without dialogues    the movie is all about images and remarkable sound    i don t really know why this is called an action movie    except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies    first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie    then desaster strikes    sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around    i looked for the   action   but couldn t find it    most of the time she is part of the decoration    the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door    now we know that she can handle a chain saw    we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds    the bomb defusal of course goes wrong   but only the furniture is damaged   not our heroes who still are needed    jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie   helping other passengers and frolicking in the water    his initial sea sickness is suddenly gone   because there are ship   crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger    he does a pretty good job but i can t blame keanu reeves for declining this part    then there s willem dafoe   the villain   who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein s monster    he doesn t succeed   though    an untidy appearance isn t enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential    before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror    i can t really recommend speed 2   you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren t meant to be funny    especially the showdown   when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat    there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie    in keeping with last year s desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death    a really funny   and meant to be funny   scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision    some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie    had they looked out the window they wouldn t have missed the huge ship racing toward them    those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects    in an adequately equipped theater it s as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate    but the ilm special effects can t save the movie    for all the money they could have done better    
1195	1	on the basis of this film alone   i never would have predicted that   in two years   quentin tarantino would become the country s biggest hotshot director    reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction   but is a much less substantive   more conventional crime story than the big pf    here s what the two movies do have in common          scenes of intelligent   amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot   a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical   chronological sequence   graphic yet necessary violence   an engaging crime story   dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial gender slurs   three of the same actors   harvey keitel   tim roth and steve buscemi     a mexican standoff ending   although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf  reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it s only got one story to tell rather than three    crime lord joe cabot   veteran actor lawrence tierney   has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist    the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated    instead   they are all given code names off the color chart    mr   white   keitel     mr   pink   buscemi     mr   orange   roth     mr   blonde   michael madsen     mr   brown   tarantino   and mr   peach   tarantino s chin      most of the movie s running time is spent with mr   white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive    mr   orange   meanwhile   is on the floor   dying from a gunshot wound    the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon   leading white to believe one of the five was an informant    the story s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks   of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime    eventually   blonde arrives with a police officer hostage   and what follows is a truly brutal   uncomfortable torture scene    let s just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop s ear    a lot of the time   reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist gone wrong movie   but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino    the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn t live up to   as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on   among other things   tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna s   like a virgin      another scene involves roth s lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana    neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop   like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction   only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie    reservoir dogs is good but it s no pulp fiction    
1709	1	the reunion film is not an original idea in any way   shape   or form    it s been done throughout film history over and over again   and has become one of the many sub genres   like the prep school sub genre   the angst filled teen sub genre   and the slasher sub genre    what makes   peter s friends   so remarkable is not how it doesn t follow the rules of this sub genre   but how it follows it so well   and creates characters that i wouldn t mind hanging with    what are the rules of the reunion sub genre    well          1   you need a group of friends   most of them married or at least dating   and sometimes even married or dating eachother    2   you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis    3   they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart    4   the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10    5   they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic    6   the reunion has to bring them together   seperate them with little crises   then bring them back together because   after all   they re friends    7   there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited    8   eightly   they re all unhappy or marginally so    9   there s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that s built up over the years    10   the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts   sometimes internationally so    11   the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends   sometimes causing them to get together in dance song    since it follows these rules so closely   it will probably be   and has been   coined off as just a   british  big chill        and in some ways it is    both follow the rules   as i said   and both feature lots of bitching   big confessionals   and broken relationships    but while   the big chill   was   at least to me   a tad too whiny and unsatisfying     peter s friends   hits its mark   making this film funny   dramatic   and poignant    the friends of peter s were all in the same theatre group back in  82   performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them   the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus      after peter s   stephen fry   wealthy father   richard briers   hardly on screen enough to register   but oh well   dies   leaving a giant mansion to him   he has to decide whether or not to keep it    not sure what to do with it immeadiately   he decides to throw a giant reunion party   inviting back all his old chums    of course   all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule    andrew   kenneth branagh   also directing here   is an actor who s unhappily married to a tv star   carol   co writer rita rudner      maggie   emma thompson   is a successfuly publisher of self help books   but looks like she needs them more than her customers   as she is lonely and unhappy    roger and mary   hugh laurie and imelda staunton   who were also married in   sense and sensibility     are married   and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk   but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died    and sarah   alphonsia emmanuel   is as promiscuous as ever   having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian   tony slattery   who s married and wants a divorce because of her   giving her doubts    as for peter   things seem okay        the film features lots of inner friend jokes   and even some old theatre anecdotes   which i at least find a lot of fun in   as i ve done lots of theatre myself      and there are big confessions   brawls between the friends   and by the end   almost everyone is unhappy   even though some have resolved their problems long before the end   which i kinda dug      the final twist would seem forced an anti climactic   but for some reason   i felt the same way the rest of the friends did    maybe it s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique    that s really what makes   peter s friends   so lovable   the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes   but when someone s in crisis   can come together wonderfully for one another    it s when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends   and these people are true friends    not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s   a decade i grew up in   unfortunately   without taking us outside of the 90s    there are some 80s classics and anti classics like tears for fears   everybody wants to rule the world     but unfortunately no stupid fun 80s songs   i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film   i d put some crap go gos song on   or at least some good old   come on eileen       but this is the british 80s we re talking about    oh well    but anyway   the direction is pretty good   although nothing amazing    branagh s forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical   but at least he s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this    the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman   with lots of good one liners   and even some really bad but good puns   to mock the fact that andrew lives in l   a     peter   while cutting some logs   asks him is he has wood in l   a     and andrew says     no   but we have hollywood     punishment like that      the actors   as in most speaking movies   are better than their material   though   with some stand out performances to the six friends   as well as the outsiders like slattery   rudner   and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter s mansion    a little note should be made about hugh laurie s performance   as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this   i mean   i ve never seen him actually act this dramatically       peter s friends   is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion   although i don t know what kind i ll have   like most people   i don t look forward to my high school reunion      because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation   i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that

731	0	as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding   especially three times    but   alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber    it s amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything    the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful    this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor    well   this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded    along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber    thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience    the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber   but it seems to have a life of its own    this is there strictly for the kids    the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs    although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone    the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at   get his fiancee back   finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire   and do all this in the funniest way possible    admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original   the absent minded professor      the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable    the basketball players   stereotypically unqualified for the sport   somehow manage to bounce   fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning    this just sounds too bad to be true   the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance    as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie    giving life to the flubber   which is so poorly executed that it s best forgotten   and prof   brainard s flying robot weebo    giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn t for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie    the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well   but it wasn t and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good    now   weebo is a totally different story    it s a robot that prof   brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too    this is a really original idea   well maybe not   but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie    yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters    the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all    the acting by robin williams   prof    brainard   seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced    most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12    people when stood up at the altar   don t usually give third chances    or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards   but what can be expected this is a children s movie    flubber   as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect    with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great    it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end   but it does not wash up to the original    kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they ll probably enjoy the whole movie    as a movie it s just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that    
1867	1	every once in a while   a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise    i don t necessarily mean in terms of quality   rather   i m referring to the mere knowledge of its existence    usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance   but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo    it has slipped rather quietly into limited release   and appears destined to slip out just as quietly    that s a shame   because princess caraboo is a delightful fable   romantic   gentle and very appealing    what s more   it s surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp witted lesson in english social history    princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england   involving a young woman   phoebe cates   who is found wandering the countryside    apparently unable to speak any english   she is taken in by good hearted gentlewoman mrs   worrall   wendy hughes      her banker husband   jim broadbent   is none too pleased about this strange houseguest   until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island   the princess caraboo    this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr   worrall   and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs   worrall    however   local journalist john gutch   stephen rea   is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be   and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo    as a social satire and comedy of manners   princess caraboo is a winner    it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars   and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing    but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr   worrall   a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude    he is worse than one of the idle rich   he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them   and since the house and money are all from mrs   worrall   he is a bit too close to them for comfort    while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule   director and co writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light hearted to be heavy handed    he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes   as the princess becomes a   sensation   at court    in one of the film s best sequences   princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent   a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions     and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance    it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in   sensations     an idea that takes on a timeless quality   and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show      social commentary aside   princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment    the performers are mostly delightful   particularly phoebe cates   who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime    her supporting players are also appealing   wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs   worrall   kevin kline as frixos   the worralls  suspicious and superior greek butler   stephen rea as the world weary but ultimately romantic gutch    only john lithgow is a disappointment   turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess s identity    the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt   without becoming gimmicky    it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn t given more time to develop   because the potential seemed to be there    when it finally does blossom   it seems too quick to be plausible    princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp    still   it has both escapist and intellectual appeal   and is well worth seeking out    it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding  a hidden gem    
1895	1	let me open this one with a confession   i love cop movies    i adore them with such an unwavering   near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998 s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers   steven    was it any good    well   just about as good as baldwin s steven seagal impression   for those i ve confused the answer is a resounding no        now let me clarify   i don t love just any cop movie   i m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80 s and now slowly   gulp   returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker    i m partial to those gritty   earthy cop dramas like serpico   donnie brasco   and the french connection    problem is these films come along just about as often as george w   bush makes a cogent point so whenever a   true   cop movie does hit multiplexes   i come running towards it like an eager puppy       and inevitably i leave   head bowed   tripping over my squiggly tail    so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out  7   50 for a movie called one tough cop   which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin off   no        truth is i m a sucker for those barren streets   that gritty   graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops   like modern day knights   must shield us from their iniquitous clutches    yes it s all very corny and awfully boys clubish   which   i m guessing   is precisely where these feelings come from    as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe s   enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies   etc   the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies   and heighten them   turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos    as an adult my tastes haven t changed all that drastically   sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film   but i still delight at the promise a   guy   film could potentially bring    now what if it s the cops who re the corrupt ones    ooh that one really gets me going   these protectors using all that at their service   taking advantage of others for their own gain    throw a courtroom drama   yech      into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city    how absorbing is prince of the city   you ask    so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama   a sub genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar   i remained completely and utterly involved    the film stars treat williams   who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at    since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city   i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn t       though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves      like mickey rourke and eric roberts   both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory   williams is a talented leading man who didn t make it to where he should have       if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell      here   the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino s in serpico   also directed by lumet      williams plays danny ciello   a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre juliani streets of new york    they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes    and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done    the squad relies entirely on informants   low level junkies   to gain access to the big wigs   and in order to obtain the info they seek   they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice    danny has done this   and though he s a fairly honorable guy   who took the job in order to do good   his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way    he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a   double agent      he does so with one condition   he will not rat on his partners    right away we know that that is exactly what he ll have to do    and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be    undercover cop films are almost innately exciting   even the kind that pull out all the cliches   like in too deep      how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal   ambiguity   and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position    prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive   hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet   as well as a handful of intense performances   most notably by treat    lumet s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back   and lets the camera soak up the action    his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension   and he rarely holds for reaction shots   instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking    lumet s worst tendency is one that many film makers   especially oliver stone   tend to overuse   he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension    this isn t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan   lumet s most recent cop   lawyer endeavor   a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching    though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices   maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something     the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria   here he was on   sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot    some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic    hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable    of course cop movies aren t popular anymore   yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines     but just look at the average hollywood action movies   flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn t gay   the lame comic relief character who s never funny   and on and on    for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop   courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills    it focuses completely on its story   and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies    there s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches   but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing    this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film   even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon   not one damn tear   it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human   excuse me   weak    in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness   straining to get the words out    he s lost his voice    does that little itty bitty detail matter    maybe not to most   but it sure made my night    and in a sprawling epic of corruption   greed   betrayal and violence it s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things    
738	0	   battlefield earth   is the best comedy of the year    it has to be    the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider    bad movie syndrome struck me again   so after witnessing how much   battlefield earth   has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles   i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first hand    is it as bad as advertised    oh yes   very much so    the plot is incomprehensible    the acting is atrocious    the special effects are mediocre    the action is dull    the implausibilities are legion    the dialogue is cringe inducing    the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny    i don t even want to continue reviewing this movie   i d like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible   but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory   so here it is    the premise is basically a rip off of   planet of the apes     only minus the apes and philosophical discussion   and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo    the year is 3000   the psychlos have conquered earth   and the human population has been enslaved    only a handful of humans escaped to radiation rich areas to escape the aliens   they live out their lives in fear    one man   johnny goodboy   i know   i know   tyler   barry pepper     ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos    there he confronts the psychlo head of security   a big   ugly   klingon looking creature called terl   john travolta      pressed into slavery   johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back    meanwhile   terl is faced with his own problems   he has recently learned that he s stuck living on earth   which he hates   for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man s daughter    he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology   this is where the plot gets ridiculous              so the   man animal   can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can t go    terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself    of course   his plan doesn t work    so many things wrong with this movie    where to begin    how about with travolta   whose hollywood clout brought about this   the cinematic version of scientology guru l   ron hubbard s sci fi novel    early previews for   battlefield earth     with constant shots of a makeup laden travolta cackling like lex luthor   had me   and several audience members   remarking     what the hell is travolta thinking      the movie did nothing to stem such remarks    all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here   terl cackles after nearly every line   and so does every other psychlo    of course   this makes every scene hilariously overwrought   no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary    the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america   but ceos generally don t laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees         you were going to be promoted    but now you re not    fwahahahahahahahaha                it s no big surprise terl loses to the humans    he s an idiot    he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book    he underestimates his enemies   assuming he ll win just because he s smarter       he uses the word   leverage   like some sort of scientologist mantra      not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero   he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos  language and technology       why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me      he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him    no wonder this guy never got his promotion    the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention    why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive    how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open    how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1   000 years    and how do all these previously brain dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly    there s a whole lot more to scratch one s head about in   battlefield earth      bring a scorecard to track the plot holes    director roger christian shoots   battlefield earth   in the most distracting way possible   tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason    all the characters appear to be standing on the walls   and it s awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue    the action sequences are atrociously edited   every one turned into an endless slow motion parade that drains all potential excitement    are these things really so hard to construct    my respect for supposed   lightweight   action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in   battlefield earth   how badly an action sequence can be shot    this movie is an absolute headache    it s not just the shot selection and editing   the movie   quite frankly   makes no sense    for most of   battlefield earth s   running time   i just didn t know what was happening    it didn t have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical   though they certainly are      i really had no idea what the hell was going on    when i pieced the plot together later   it didn t look any better    here s how much of a disaster this is     battlefield earth   is already the worst movie of the year   and it s going to take something really   really inept to top it    the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it    in fact   i d think that hubbard s cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible    that ll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again    
1076	1	mpaa   not rated   though i feel it would likely be pg   for martial arts violence      with three movies already   re   released theatrically in america   and at least three more on their way   jackie chan is one of the newest   hot properties   in action adventure stardom   and it s just about time    for over twenty five years   jackie s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong   thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy       drunken master   has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to   make it big     this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong    i m not entirely sure why   exactly    in many ways     drunken master   is similar to most of jackie s other early films   such as   fearless hyena   i and ii     master with cracked fingers       half a loaf of kung fu       spiritual kung fu     and others    in fact   looking at all these early films together   one gets the impression that they were stamped out   cookie cutter style   at a rate of four to six per year   all using the same casts and telling very similar stories    to be honest   i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste    they re quite different from action movies as we know them in america    these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past   with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together       drunken master     though its plot is tighter than some   is no exception       as an aside     drunken master   was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw   and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen       in  a movie theater in seattle   as part of an asian film festival    at the time   i didn t really think it was anything special       but  after having seen more films like it   it s kind of grown on me         drunken master    s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies   such as   fearless hyena   i and ii and   master with cracked fingers     slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh seeming master   and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end   a formula that has been   adapted     to put it kindly   by american films such as karate kid      more specifically   jackie chan plays the part of wong fei hong   aka   naughty panther     a fun loving   practical joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good   but not  quite  good enough    after embarrassing his instructor s assistant by beating him roundly   then beating up a bully in a marketplace   wong fei hong tries to hit on a pretty girl   but discovers that she   and her mother   can hit back   better than he can       and  is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt   respectively    his father   wong kei ying   is unhappy about this   and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages    kei ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment   which fei hong does not like at all    while escaping from this punishment   fei hong meets up with a drunken old man   who proceeds to thrash him soundly   then take him on as a student and thrash him some more    this turns out to be su hua chi   a legendary master of drunken style kung fu    he assigns fei hong a series of bizarre tasks   such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame   cracking walnuts with his hands   and other such exercises   that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up    then   when he s ready   he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu    unfortunately   the lazy fei hong only practices six of them           drunken master   features some wonderful martial arts sequences   with jackie winning some fights and losing others    it s been said before   but i ll say it again  these fights don t just  happen    they re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance   and it shows    in his fights   jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment   benches   jugs   cups   bowls   fruits and vegetables  often in new and surprising ways    the fight scenes   particularly those toward the end of the film   are unparallelled in most american films    whether jackie wins or loses   it s really something to see       and  it s often as funny as anything   too    and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very   very good at    there s very little that s new in this movie  jackie winning fights   jackie getting beaten badly by a master   jackie going through punishment or training       these  schticks have all been seen before   in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties    but they re still hilarious as ever    likewise   jackie has a  great  supporting cast   many of whom were also in other early jackie films   and they re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own    the really big thing about   drunken master     though   that inspired several copycats   including a couple starring jackie himself   and a sequel fifteen years later   was the drunken style kung fu    i m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu   but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security       and  it apparently helps if you re drunk while you re doing it    genuine or not   i have to admit   there s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what s going on    come to think of it   perhaps this element is what accounts for this film s success over any of the other jackie films       it s  not just martial arts   it s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go     whoa          on the negative side   the cinematography in this film is nothing special   the film stock is rather primitive   the plot is often rather slow   and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background       gone with the wind     this isn t    still   if you like martial arts films   or like what you ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more   give it a shot    it s much more   real   than chuck norris or jean claude van damme    you might very well like it    another interesting thing about   drunken master   has to do with its video availability in the us       drunken master   is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original   letterboxed   hong kong subtitled form   commercially available on vhs   from magnum video   in a gold box   for about  10      there are plenty of other early jackie films around   but these are typically either in dubbed   pan and scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase    thankfully     drunken master     at least   is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen   at a very affordable price    if you like   drunken master     take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there   even the dubbed ones aren t really  too  bad       if  nothing else   you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue      i particularly recommend   spiritual kung fu       half a loaf of kung fu     the   fearless hyena   movies   and   snake   crane arts of shaolin      also   the mostly unrelated storywise sequel     drunken master ii     will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year   though what its american release title will be is still uncertain   and comes  highly  recommended by this reviewer    also   for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei hong   who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore     i ve been told to suggest the   once upon a time in china   series starring jet li   though i haven t personally seen any of them yet      if you choose to watch   drunken master     i really hope you enjoy it   and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that s out there    all in all   i give this film an

1731	1	titantic   writer and director james cameron s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed  200   000   000 epic   arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises   whether the film is worth it    as a business proposition   it seems hard to see how it can ever break even   but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful    if you ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure   think again    the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers    in either case   it is filmmaking at its best    when we entered the press screening   my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long    he said no but that the time would go by so fast she d never notice the length    amazingly   he was right    titanic is one of the few long films that doesn t suffer because of it    the lush picture   filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm   opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean    fortune hunter brock lovett   bill paxton   leads the expedition looking for the world s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship   known back then as   the ship of dreams      the necklace s hundred year old former owner   rose dewitt bukater   gloria stuart     finds brock to tell him her story    although almost all of the movie happens in flashback   one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk    using a computer simulation   the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later   which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing    after twenty minutes   the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage    in a classic movie theme   the two parts of the ship   first class and steerage   third class   exist in sharp contrast    the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing    entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance   cal hockley   played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane    and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand   an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class    even with her own promenade deck   rose feels trapped on the ship   what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes    in contrast   jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board    after jack saves rose from committing suicide   they start a brief but impassioned love affair    never tawdry and rarely explicit   their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story    leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma    in so many ways   small and large   he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part    when he confronts cal   for example   he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal s supercilious put downs    kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose    the chemistry between these two academy award nominees   him for what s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility   is nothing short of astonishing    from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude   they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances    if the film breaks after an hour and a half   which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up   you will still get one of the best films of the year    peter lamont s sets are more than authentic    one scene   for example   starts with the planning to retire captain   played with insouciance by bernard hill   having his tea on deck    it then shifts to the ship s massive gears and then to the bright hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals    the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner    easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest    at first   since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull   not some big gaping hole   the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else    what a lark    we ve struck an iceberg    now let s get back to our brandy and cigars    the ship s musicians play like troopers through it all   even after the panic sets in    after all   they see it as their duty to calm the passengers    when the musicians are about to die   they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together   and they mean it    their civility borders on insanity   but it is touching nevertheless    the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface    there are more than enough characters to love and to hate   and all of the casting is dead on    special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable    in titanic   for which he created a nine tenths scale model of the entire ship   cameron strove for accuracy at all costs    the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two   and the front section becomes vertical in the water    people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately    besides being romantic and dramatic   the script includes liberal doses of humor    from the many deliciously subtle verbal put downs to the physical comedy   as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man   the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears       it s good bye for a little while     a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first       this boat s for mommies and children    there ll be a boat in a little while for daddies      basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats    it made the decks look too crowded otherwise    perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim s on board the ship    in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink   he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew       no thanks     the elegantly attired guggenheim replies       we re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen    but we would like a brandy      titanic runs 3   14    it is rated pg 13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up    
1426	1	i can sum up first strike in one word   awesome    never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan    for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he s ever appeared in   he should be awarded greatly    the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan s rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well    however   first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three   for the simple reason that practice makes perfect    his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great    like rumble   this film is about the mafia   the former kgb    now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men    the trailer for the film sums it up quite well    first strike is action packed   but the fight scenes are so fast and furious   they almost have a witty   italian like humor to them    jackie chan is a regular comedian    well   he s no eddie murphy   but he can really crack you up    for example   he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him   as he claims to be the korean 007   that s secret agent james bond      even the plot to this film improved above the others   as a sort of twisted nuclear weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame    but never fear   as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident    with some of the most high flying stunts and side splitting comedy   first strike is a sure fire hit that s guaranteed to draw some major   world wide attention

847	0	what a contrast    in the space of two days   i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly    i m not sure you could get two more different movies    while the former was all over the top   telegraphing everything   shoving its philosophy of life down our throats   hurlyburly was the complete opposite   wound so tight and with so much buried in its script   one could spend weeks thinking about it    this is one interesting movie    it s very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of  98   in the company of men   although not quite so nasty    there s lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men    hurlyburly doens t contain much plot   we just follow eddie   sean penn   around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him    his big question is   does it all pertain to him    and if it does   how is he supposed to feel about it all       it   means everything   television   friends   events that happen    i guess it could be summed up more crudely as   what s it all about    this is not a movie for answers    donna   anna paquin   gives some but they re not really satisfying   they just lead to more questions    that s what makes this movie stay on your mind    these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time    even when we push them to the background   however we resolve these questions influences everything we do    the performances are all superb in hurlyburly    i haven t seen sean penn in much before   in fact   i can t remember seeing him in anything     but he is brilliant in this    eddie isn t a likeable character   but sean penn makes him understandable    i don t want to be his friend but i d like to help him    chazz palminteri is also great as phil   making him an awful person    i d never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend    everyone in this film nails their performances   making this world real    it s a nasty world   it s a sexist world    unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct   hurlyburly is a man s world   seen unapologetically through the eyes of men    i find this fascinating and on two counts   depressing    first   it s depressing that such a world exists    a large part of hurlyburly s success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood   that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world   toys   playthings    sure   everyone is background to everyone else but in this world   women are a long way in the background    second   these are the movies that are being made   stories about men s world    where are the stories about women s world    not the soap operas and the   chick flicks   that are meant to satisfy women   but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men    hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts    it s very talkative   intelligent and static    while this can make the film drag a bit   and people sometimes sound like they re quoting textbooks   mostly this is a good thing    not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas    not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience    all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen    it also means that you have to pay attention    
1094	1	a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates   a film which was based on the best seller by george v     higgins    it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51 year old   small time hood   eddie   fingers   coyle   mitchum      he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment    his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3 5 year stretch in new hampshire   something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn t think he could survive prison at his age    he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare    he could have cut a deal and gotten off   if he turned his boss over to the d   a     but he figured he would never live if he did that    he is currently gun running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise   rocco      the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager s house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it    on one of the heists   they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm    coyle s best friend is dillon   boyle     a hit man for the mob   working as a bartender    he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents   as an aggressive young agent named foley   jordan     who likes to be called uncle   gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record   as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs    with the sentencing date closing in on him   the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time    he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain    thinking he made an iron clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire   he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down   knowing full well the young hustler   keats   selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence    but foley tells him after he arrests the gun dealer   that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence   they want him to be a full time informer    warning   spoiler follows in next paragraph    the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend    the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up    coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says     to be young like that and have his future   he s the greatest hockey player in the world      dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob style   having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston    this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets   of the hopeless situation the low level criminals are in   and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next    the city streets are ugly   the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests   whether it is betrayal or murder    there is a fatalistic feel about their lives   something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat    mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs   as it overcomes a thin plot    it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them    mitchum is a loser   and   that he lived so long   is a tribute to his skills as a survivor    but in the end   he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy   as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle

487	0	when critics attack seemingly well intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do   their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e mails   sometimes even mock death threats from those who   i suppose   like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment    even politicians        tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good hearted films while praising   filth   like pulp fiction    these  fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with  tend to forget that a film critic s job is to review the movie   not the message   however sweet and endearing that message may be    thusly patch adams isn t a bad film because it s about a doctor who cares for his patients   it s a bad film because it s a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation    similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place   though i even doubt that   stay tuned   an explanation is forthcoming     it s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess    the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher   a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey     with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude   who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world    12 year old trevor   haley joel osmet     a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother   helen hunt     comes up with the notion to pay it forward   this entails a person doing one good deed   call it an uber favor   for three others   then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we re all living in a frank capra movie    meanwhile in a parallel story   a weasely reporter   jay mohr   tracks the   movement   which has apparently begun to grow    pay it forward has odd ideas about tone   at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core    it s as if director mimi leder didn t have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended   and compromised out of fear that her film wasn t   gutsy   enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for    so the picture adds grit   a child molester propositions trevor   a homeless man returns to heroin after being   saved     a character is knifed while doing a good deed   etc   though it seems shallow   incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn t quite sure if it s ready to buy into its own utopian blather    pay it forward offers   crowd pleasing   elements for general audiences   jay mohr s umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball   angie dickinson s earthy alcoholic bag woman   and the jive talking   black hoodlum with a heart of gold     coming on the heals of the black   god like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled   this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich      hurray for hollywood   who actually calls the mohr character a   nigga   and says things like   can you feel me      leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment       maybe spike s flick wasn t so misguided after all      these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings    while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place   to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience    it s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration   with the main players   all previous oscar winners or nominees   given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns    one scene in which a slightly de glamed helen hunt   de glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim  her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama    hunt s hair is also natty and badly bleached   verbally castigates spacey   feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip    spacey   of course   responds in his cultured monotone   that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance    maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating   though how can he not   even when he s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference    the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender    in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet   immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke   and with said hand still on said mouth   she actually begins convulsing   dry heaving really     then   and i m not making this up   she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol    the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow ups   it s all very theatrical   especially hunt s performance   which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar    pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn t get academy awards    the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists    even haley joel osemt   the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense   seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections    his acting has become broader   less intimate   it s as if we can make out the little munchkin s thoughts     boy this outta floor em      naturally osmet is made to play one of those only in the movies children   a martyr figure who cleans up after his mother   lectures her on the ills of drinking   and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher    never mind that the two couldn t be more dissimilar   his mother is trailer trash dopey   and the teacher is one of those dennis miller ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary    nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap ish cornball antics    but oh how we love bright   articulate   self sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life    they re so adorable    of course the blame can t all be hoisted onto the actors   though with the exception of the little kid   they probably should have known better     instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder   who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er   then went on to make two awful genre films in a row    the first being the peacemaker   a witless post cold war george clooney vehicle   and deep impact   one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth s possible demise by a crazed meteorite    the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich   s   and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement   not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out   apparently present for an invisible audience      deep impact has more in common with pay it forward   it s a movie that treats earth s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms   completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days    the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing   though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching    in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal     see my movie isn t as na   ve as you might think   she seems to be saying    no   it s just horribly confused    
852	0	1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood   two movies dealing with the same subject   or   to be precise   same   high concept      in summer 1994   that   high concept   was   mad bomber action thriller      in few weeks     thrillride of the summer   actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away   so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes    the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland   where gaerity   tommy lee jones     ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material   escapes from prison    he comes to boston   where he accidentally notices jimmy dove   jeff bridges     dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police    few people except gaerity know the dove s violent past   when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence   betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose    gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror   directed specifically at dove s colleagues   friends and relatives    dove   who is just going to retire and start family   now must confront the mad bomber    while speed doesn t even try to bother with plot and characters   using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes   blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story    and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed    badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all    screenplay by john bateer and john rice   barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland   using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama    the plot is   of course   full of implausibilities    the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual   no matter how brilliant he is   can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay    those questions   same as in the case of speed   could be forgotten while the action goes on   but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters    because of them   movie seems a little bit too long   and boring at times    the most annoying element of the film   however   is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber    his acting is so over the top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself    this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive    the film have few bright points   though    some of the action scenes are fine   which should be credited to director stephen hopkins   predator ii   judgement night      and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove s colleague    but   all in all   blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous   yet hardly unforgettable competitor

stakes poker    that s right    i m not sure if it s his main source of income   but from what i ve heard   the guy occasionally comes away with  20   000 at a time    and there you were   thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off broadway theater    you silly goose    well   gabe kaplan isn t in the movie rounders   nor is the film about the actor come gambler s life    but rounders is about poker   and gabe plays poker   and i thought that was kind of a neat connection    sorry about the segue   or lack thereof    matt damon plays mike mcdermott   a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker    he s been playing for a while   and more than being proficient   he has caught the bug    he goes to all the underground games in new york city   knows the regulars   and knows how to win    in the beginning of the film   he s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg   which he takes to the speakeasy type gaming parlor where the big boys play    mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb   john malkovich     an oreo munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia    mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker   but instead he loses it all in a single hand    months later   he s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck    when mike s best friend and poker buddy worm   edward norton   finishes his jail term for hustling some students   he wants to pick up right were they left off   working as a team to part others with their betting cash    although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student   jo   gretchen mol     worm connives mike into playing once more   and mike   bitten again by the bug   slides down that slippery slope   risking his relationship   education   and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life    to make a film about gambling   a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters    this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth    rounders   however   seems to go more for the latter than the former    the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren t very glamorous at all    there s a basement   a lodge with elk heads on the wall   a goulash joint   these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots    except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city   the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table    the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it    we re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations   and good actors to play them    matt damon is very natural as mike   who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school   and answering what may be his true calling   playing professional poker    ed norton s worm is truly a worm   always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they re worth    john turturro   who amazes me with his acting range   tones it down in this film by playing joey knish   a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments    he s both a friend and mentor to mike   and turturro s low key performance is totally convincing   just as john malkovich s heavily accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself    martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike s law professors   abe petrovsky    while landau slips well into the role   his character   spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one s self   facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending    perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line up of acting talent   however   is gretchen mol who just didn t seem to have much presence on screen    she s a genuine peach to look at   kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel   and i wouldn t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world     but her delivered lines seemed very flat   and i found myself looking for matt damon s reactions instead    a good thing about rounders is that it doesn t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can t find time for humor    the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going   such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next   in widely different locales    one game in a cigar club had me in stitches       i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper     says one of the players   clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other    i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys    with all the poker being played   rounders had the potential to be very confusing    you might think you know a lot about poker   but think again    luckily   we re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what s going on    the narrations are more informative than intrusive   and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do    it s nice that as the characters develop   so does our comprehension of their world    as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker   rounders delivers in spades    wait    as a film about the culture of cards   rounders is an ace    hang on    packed with great acting and great characters   rounders is a full house    okay   i guess that s enough    oh   by the way   if you ever want to get into a game with ol  gabe kaplan   be sure to bring a note from epstein s mother

1556	1	there s good news and bad news about mulan    the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules    on the other hand   the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs   several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast    but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney s best animated feature since the lion king    after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas   disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians    mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married    that s what we find out when young mulan   voice of ming  na wen   screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her    cartoons        meanwhile   word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns    since mulan s a girl   that means her decrepit old father must go    she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad   but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family    that s chinese culture for you        so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father s uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place    the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army    it should have been called g   i    chang    mulan calls on her ancestors for help    they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her   but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up    voiced by eddie murphy   mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges    murphy s performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin    lots of wisecracks and ad libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they re going to have    you ain t never had a friend like mushu    speaking of songs   mulan doesn t have too many of them   which is a plus with a story like this    disney songs about war probably wouldn t go over too well     heigh ho   heigh ho   it s off to war i go             and the ones they do have aren t memorable    the best of the bunch   sad to say   is   be a man     the requisite basic training montage song    yes   even in medieval china   they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle    sung by donnie osmond   a bad sign if ever there was one       be a man   accompanies footage of mulan s platoon going from screw ups to heroes    it makes me wonder   has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that s ended badly    i only wish real life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage    for the curious   mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl    all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder length   talk macho and slap guys on the butt   as was male custom a thousand years ago in china    the deception fools everyone but the audience   who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12 year old boy   at best    but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army   led by a big   evil eyed attilla looking monster    as a villain   the head of the huns is menacing   evil and entirely forgettable    i saw the movie yesterday and i don t remember the man s name    otherwise   mulan is a good movie    the animation of the characters themselves isn t as rich as it could and should be   but there are some amazing battlefield shots    eddie murphy pulls off some good one liners   as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita   the quintessential asian movie star    hell   george   mr   sulu   takei does a voice in mulan    you get the sense disney said to themselves     alright   let s get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood    who can you think of         well   there s mr   myagi             good         and mr   sulu         perfect    we ve got ourselves a movie now      soon disney really  will  be able to paint with all the colors of the wind    
1215	1	in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library   casablanca was my third classic in some weeks    the others being citizen kane and vertigo   yes   i am trying to see as many of afi s greatest movies ever made as i can      but   casablanca stood out from the rest for me   it was actually watchable    what most hail as the greatest american film ever   casablanca isn t so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in    it seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman    that annoyed me   as did the ending    why didn t the plan turn around        surprisingly   i enjoyed the film    i liked bogart s character and his acting   not over the top as most actors in his era      i once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie   which one would it be   and a women said casablanca    at first i was thinking to myself   why      then   as i watched the film again   i understood why    the movie is very well done and the script top notch   although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo    casablanca is   in my mind   no classic   like solaris     but it is a good film and stylishly shot    hey   hollywood   how about this   a remake with harrison ford and anne heche    now that would be a classic    
1565	1	in the opening shot of midnight cowboy   we see a close up of a blank movie screen at a drive in    we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses  hooves    without an image projected onto the screen   the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind s eye    even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie   somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema    but do cowboys really exist   or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper    exploring this theme   director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream   an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept    is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend    midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream   like image of the cowboy   is merely a myth    as joe buck migrates from place to place   he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself   only further degeneration    during the opening credits   joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads  john wayne   the alamo      as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show   a lady on the air describes her ideal man as  gary cooper   but he s dead      a troubled expression comes across joe s face   as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone    having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth   joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody    joe s persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream    he romanticizes about making it in the big city   but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance    by the end of midnight cowboy   joe buck loses everything and gains nothing    just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen   we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success    but how realistic are these ideals    joe had raped and been raped in texas    the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york   but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas    alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation    the ability to pack up one s belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention    schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe s abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny    we understand that joe adopts the fa   ade of a cowboy   a symbol of virility and gallantry   as an attempt to neutralize his shame    he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york    in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe s encounter with the gay student   joe buck spills ketchup on himself    standing up   we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh    schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe s virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals   signifying emasculation    beyond the symbol of castration   the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin s first sexual encounter   a reference to joe s first homosexual liaison    the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe s emasculation    it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients   but effortlessly attracts men    joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity   new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and  faggot stuff      there are two predominant images of new york    the first is that new york is the rich   cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty    the other new york is travis bickle s new york   a seedy   corruptive hell on earth    joe envisions new york as the former   but is presented with the latter    mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine   he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men    joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york   but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions    the people steal joe s money   the landlord confiscates his luggage   and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity    what has become of joe s american dream    schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party    joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food   drugs   and sex    at the party   all of joe and ratzo s desires are made flesh   joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami    contrasting joe s daily struggles   shots of warhol s crew display wanton indulgence    there is an irreverence in the partygoers  attitude   we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular   orgies breaking out in the periphery   and drugs passed around like party favors    the party makes a mockery of joe  s ideals    joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america   scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe s toils    the american dream   schlesinger suggests   is merely a proletarian fantasy   for those who are content no longer dream   but become indolent    as joe heads to miami   all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him    his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished    for joe   nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately   he surrenders the identity    tossing his boots into the garbage   he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami    the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus   more introspective   taking only a few glances outside the window    instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york   schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe    reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus  window with joe hardly taking notice    the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before    the world seems smaller to joe now   the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream    no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo   he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means    midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream    there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians   you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family    then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock   with perseverance   can make a fortune in the big city    joe s attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york    during his search for an intangible paradise   joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man    an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream   joe buck s progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons    
996	0	movies like six days   seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford   anne heche   and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents      the script was written by michael browning   and he decided that   instead of thinking up new ideas   he d rehash a lot of cliches   omit even the slightest bit of character development   and then throw in drug dealing pirates to provide for a few high level action sequences and explosions      there are good scripts out there that high profile actors can make   see the truman show   for instance        six days   seven nights is simply a waste    let s see            we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island      so   how do we do that      well   we ll make her a feisty magazine editor   and we ll make him a crusty old pilot      but wait   she has to have a fianc   e   that can be david schwimmer      but wait   if she has a fianc   e   how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone      i know      they ll get to their vacation spot   and then she ll get called back      yessssss      so   they ll crash on the island   and that will be funny for about five minutes      shucks    oh   i ve got it      we ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc   e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo   and then he can feel guilty      then   when anne heche kisses harrison ford   they have to kiss   because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie     it will be a vindicated action   because her fianc   e will already have cheated on her      then   for no obvious reason   they ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them      oh   yes      i feel so good about this story      instead of using characterization to propel the events   it will be completely random   and yet totally predictable      imagine that    don t get me wrong    six days   seven nights is not a boring picture   ford and heche both do a great job      the sparks fly between them   and so most of browning s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors  sheer force of talent       almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen   and i found myself laughing pretty hard      schwimmer is also funny   and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get      and reitman   who has made some good films   at least tries to make things exciting      even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb   i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences    it s just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces      the picture feels like it s been hacked to pieces    i wouldn t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely      the ones that are here are as bad as they come   i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships     and i d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream     why did you pick this awful script          the film is outright stupid   but some of the elements are subtly horrifying      for instance   take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo   and then feels really guilty      this is a serious problem in real life   but six days   seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device     his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford      in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety   i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story    this is summer movie season   but that doesn t mean our movies have to be dumb      1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters      when i was in line for six days   seven nights   i heard the woman in front of me ask for   two tickets to that new harrison ford movie         why didn t she know the name of the film      i suppose she just didn t care       what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big budget pictures don t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves      good actors should sign to good scripts   and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash   they least they could do is assume that we d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents

of something scripted by a computer    in fact   considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas   perhaps it was    the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore    not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh   both human and non human   been scattered in all directions    we learn some bloody trivia   as well   such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red   it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains   and what it does with half digested leftovers    i suppose deep rising s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre   but it doesn t do much for me    on the surface   and that s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed   deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic   everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens titanic connection   since james cameron directed both      in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue in cheek mayhem of tremors   deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin    the film is not humorous   tense   or exciting    in fact   it s downright boring   and   despite being half the length of cameron s current box office champ   deep rising feels like the longer movie    is it really necessary to say anything about the plot    probably not   since it s easy to guess   but i ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis    the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship    in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics   there s finnegan   treat williams     the boat s pilot   who s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff   joey   kevin j   o connor     the inept sidekick who s supposed to be lovable and funny   but is really just irritating     and hanover   wes studi     the   mastermind     and i use that term lightly   of the operation    their goal   attack a cruise ship   clean out the safe   then sink it using some illegally acquired torpedoes    the problem is   by the time they reach the argonautica   the titanic like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste    aside from a beautiful jewel thief   famke janssen   and a couple of crew members   there s no one on board    the reason soon becomes obvious    the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles    the cast   which is led by treat williams   is primarily comprised of has beens and probably never will bes   two exceptions   wes studi   best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans   and djimon hounsou   amistad s cinque      williams   once a   can t miss   prospect in hollywood   has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising   and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career    famke janssen   who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye   is the perfect bland match for williams    given her limited acting abilities   it s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes    unfortunately   a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee shirt for half of the picture    meanwhile   kevin j   o connor   who has entirely too much screen time   exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard    these days   audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer generated special effects    this is a lesson that writer director stephen sommers   who previously helmed the live action jungle book   needs to learn    the days of jurassic park   when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen   are past    now   movie goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic    visuals that are so well incorporated that it s impossible to tell where they end and where   reality   begins    in deep rising   the monster   like everything   is artificial and unconvincing    unfortunately   the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture   but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre   although   to be fair   deep rising is a particularly bad entry      even once this film has sunk out of sight   the knowledgeable viewer knows it won t be the last of its kind    like the slimy   slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies   more are waiting just around the corner in ambush    and that consideration   unlike anything on screen   is truly horrifying

1767	1	i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video    it really scared me   and i didn t want to go see it    however   after i heard about how wonderful it was   i wanted to see it    i didn t get a chance to do so   until now    the film   disney s 25th animated feature   opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale   a long time ago in the land of prydain   there was a king so evil   that his spirit was captured in the cauldron    it has been hidden for centuries   and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors   and with them rule the world   and destroy it    then   we meet a farmer wizard   dallben   and his young apprentice   taran    taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a  pig keeper    they have a pig named hen wen      one day   as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath   the pig goes crazy   and dallben then realizes   after watching hen wen s thoughts through a bucket of water   that taran must hide hen wen in the forest    an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron   and only hen wen has the power to show its location    taran leads hen wen into the forest   but of course   he loses her   and tries to go find her    along the way   he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi   who desires  munchings and crunchings    much to his dismay   besides   he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen      when he hears hen wen s squeal from far away   though   he races to her rescue   only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants    taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king s castle from far away    taran climbs the castle walls   and brings himself into the castle   where he attempts to rescue hen wen    he manages to do so   but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon    there   he meets princess eilonwy   and her magic bauble   another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron     and the two escape through the deep castle walls    along the way   taran finds a sword in a burial chamber   and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm   who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie    the three manage to escape the horned king s castle   but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic    as they rest in the forest   gurgi reappears   claiming to have found hen wen s trail    he leads taran   eilonwy and fflewdurr   by way of  pig tracks    to a whirlpool    suddenly   they all get sucked under   and they meet the fairy like fairfolk    taran is reunited with hen wen   and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva    he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron   it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world    with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli   the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage    it turns out to be no ordinary cottage   three comically strange witches inhabit the place    when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron   they agree to let him have it   in exchange for his sword    taran agrees   much to eilonwy s horror   but at least they get the black cauldron    but   the cauldron can t be destroyed   only its evil powers can be stopped    the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will   never to return alive    things take a turn for the worse when the horned king s henchmen capture taran   eilonwy   and fflewdurr   along with the black cauldron   and lead them back to the castle    taran   eilonwy   and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors   this is the most horrifying scene in the film   because here   a dead army comes alive        just when all seems lost   though   gurgi reappears   and rescues taran   eilonwy   and fflewdurr    taran is about to jump into the black cauldron   but gurgi stops him   not wanting him to throw his life away    gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron   and the deathless warriors decay    taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi   but he is forced to do battle against the horned king    he kicks the horned king away   who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron   where its powers immediately destroy him completely    taran   eilonwy   and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king s castle just as it self destructs    the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away   but fflewdurr stops them   saying that they  never give anything away   they bargain     in response to this   the witches offer taran his sword back   but taran instead has a new trade   the cauldron for gurgi    the trade is made   gurgi s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group    as taran cradles him in his arms   though   gurgi stirs he is not dead after all    the happy group then returns home   where hen wen   brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past     dallben   and even doli   await their triumphant return    as spectacular as it sounds   the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times    before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions   he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron   a sword and sorcery tale for the studio    bringing this book to the screen was the studio s fondest dream    miller   who entitled himself as the executive producer   promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects    when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio   the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron    by this time   things had gone really rocky for the animation department    many of the studio s old men had retired or died    therefore   the animators suffered a hard time making this film    originally budgeted at  25 million   the costs raised to  40 million because of constant changes on everything   and when it was finally released on june 24   1985   the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics   but somehow the film flopped    the film was rated pg and the film   although  disneyfied  from lloyd alexander s chronicles of prydain   which is what this film is based on     was much more scarier and darker than disney s other previous efforts   such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound   which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it    in addition   other critics rejected it for having  no heart  and  unmemorable    compared to other disney animated features    but whatever the real reason   the black cauldron was a financial disaster   grossing only  21 million    the failure of the film grounded the studio s animation department   and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale   and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio s reputation    the next two disney animated features   the great mouse detective and oliver and company   although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron   didn t do much better   although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective      only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features    as for the black cauldron   it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron    finally   the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released    because of all this   you might ask yourself   was the black cauldron really such a bad movie    the people who had seen the film didn t think so    in fact   many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film   but of course   they denied it    for a while   it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video   until september 1997   disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom    few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc   including me   and for those who hadn t seen the film yet   i am included here     they got quite a treat    but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors   about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating   in the uk   the u rating means universal   suitable for all ages   kinda like their own version of g      somewhere online   a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said    bring back the black cauldron       and because of that   disney finally decided to release the video to the united states    before that time   rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed   like the uk video   so that it would get a g rating   and that they would add in songs    those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron   would   be released in its pg rated version    even still   when it was finally released to the us   some reaction was mixed    some felt that it was indeed cut   but some felt that it wasn t    but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable   since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available    as for myself   when i saw the movie for the first time   on converted ntsc video     i didn t expect much at all    in fact   i had heard so many mediocre things about it   that i didn t think the film would ever be such a good film    much to my surprise   when i saw the first few minutes of the film   i was asking myself     this is the same film everyone saw    the one that flopped at the box office    the one that critics and filmgoers alike called   a bad movie      this doesn t seem like all of the above    instead   it s a classic in its own right    the film has a wonderful cast of characters    there s taran   grant bardsley     an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig keeper   the story s hero    the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all   but the opposite is true    he is brave   loyal   and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on    there s a likeable character here    not that he s the only likeable character in the film    there s gurgi   john biner     a lovable little   uh   thing who remains loyal to taran   even though they don t quite hit it off at first    but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman   a dwarf named creeper   phil fondacairo     who is loyal to the film s imaginative and sinister villain   the horned king   voiced gruesomely by john hurt     yet he also fears his neck    the other characters   including the sidekicks   a spunky   but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm   and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret   although pleasant and likeable   aren t quite as well rounded as they should be    the story itself is an adventurous one   a quest involving the mystical pig   hen wen   the black cauldron itself   and an army of deathless ones with everything   a hooking opening to a spectacular finale    elmer bernstein s music also tells the story perfectly   in a dark   yet calming manner    the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios    even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good   like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth   the animation overall is top notch    overall   this film is an entertaining endeavor    fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one   except young kids    there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney s other films   although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary     which is the main reason why this film is rated pg    fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie    even though it doesn t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film   this film is a classic in its own right   and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given    that better chance has finally come    whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared   and the film has finally achieved its place among disney s most proudest achievements    i can t help but think though   whatever would have happened if the black cauldron   was   a box office success    
246	0	i should have known   damn it   i should have known    ewan mcgregor   codename     eye     is pointing a high tech rifle ly gadget at a fat   bald business oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street    we get the requisite electro green through the sight view    we the audience   seeing a high tech rifle ly gadget   of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target   but instead   he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy   low quality photographs   which eye then proceeds to fax and e mail to everyone in his target s office    all right   so thirty seconds in   i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle camera   but i was still open minded        maybe there s a really good reason for it    i ve got reason to believe   you see   i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor s previous work        and he s obi wan ke  friggin nobi for god s sake    and director stephan elliot s last movie priscilla   queen of the desert was a quirky little delight    there s some genuine talent involved here    i think at the twenty minute mark   there was still a spark of hope in my heart    eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization s son   i still have no idea what this organization was   british intelligence    national spy ring    private investigation       who is apparently stealing from his trust fund    he has received his assignment from k   d    lang   through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase    when eye tracks his target to an expensive  looking secluded house   he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman   ashley judd   take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard    ok   that s odd   i think to myself   this could be interesting    then she starts to cry   and through her tears exclaims   merry christmas   dad      for the first time    so begins our tale of obsession        or       something    the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor s eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states   totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar    throughout his entire professional life   he has been a voyeur   so when he falls for someone   the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras    fine   that s a lovely premise   i suppose    but gosh darn it   if you re going to go there   you better have some sort of explanation    and that s precisely where this film fails    this is the kind of movie that pisses me off    it s an abortion   a collection of half formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end    it pretends it is something that it is not   a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high tech thriller    here   the filmmakers have confused   surreal   and   deep   with   vaguely unclear   and   crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors      i never   even for an instant   had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in   love   with this woman who changes wigs and kills people    the movie offers only two explanations   neither of which make a lick of sense    explanation number one   the obnoxious presence of eye s imaginary daughter   who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago   tells him he shouldn t leave ms   judd    explanation two   which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie     beauty is in the eye of the beholder      whoo hoo   that helps   thanks a bunch   case closed    that s as deep as it gets   folks    there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes   which   instead of tying everything together   ends up being as profound as a clever sixth grade mad lib    there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was    my personal favorites include   the prison matron modeled after austin powers  frau farbissina   who apparently taught ms   judd everything she knows about wearing wigs   jason priestley s awfully played dirty desert vagrant  1   who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet   but fails miserably   and the cop who sees ashley fleeing an accident scene and  then wants to pay for sex  but is shot    each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last    the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space    any time one of the frequent location changes occurs   the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe   and minutes   weeks   or years could have passed    bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair   one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow motion close up awash in a lot of bass    ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell    jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks   then laughs maniacally        cut to random guy with eye patch        iguana out of focus        iguana comes into focus    wow   man    when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel   it came as no surprise to me    there are plenty of elements here that   if extended and fleshed out more   would have made for a decent story    and i wouldn t be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere   or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director s cut        not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing    the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition    some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone   and this time i didn t particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap   the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking    someone near cell phone guy did eventually yell     shut the hell up       but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen    
635	0	   what s your favorite new york moment         this one s climbing the charts      starring john cusack   kate beckinsale   eugene levy   molly shannon    directed by peter chelsom    rated pg 13    there s no doubt that 95  of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern   guy sees girl   guy wants girl   guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl   guy gets girl    in rare cases   the genders are flipped    predictability is a given    rarely   though   is a romantic comedy as cheap   as obvious   or as pointless as serendipity   a film that uses its   theme   as an excuse for its plot contrivances       lightweight   doesn t begin to describe it    this is like anti gravity    it begins in a new york city bloomingdale s   a product placement that rivals cast away s fedex for sheer blatancy    jonathan trager   john cusack   and sara thomas   kate beckinsale   both go for the same pair of gloves    after going through the perfunctory motions   jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream   followed by ice skating    jonathan falls hard   and sara is charmed    when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper   a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand    she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn t be together   jonathan is flabbergasted    to pacify him   she comes up with an idea   jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill   which she will promptly spend    when she gets home   she will write her name and number inside a book     love in the time of cholera     and sell it to a used bookstore    if the bill gets back to her or the book to him   it will mean that they are meant to be together    three years later    both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests    both realize they aren t content    both go looking for the other    what happens now is so absurd that i m almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it    the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible   coincidences   that i would describe as contrivances if it weren t for the film oh so cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around   serendipity      of course   since the movie is about fate   the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases    i m not buying it    there s no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what s going to happen   but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly   adorable   non story into our heads    instead of   will they meet      the question we re asking is   when will they meet already      to make matters worse   every   coincidence   is telegraphed from a mile away   by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else   incredible   was going to happen    cusack is fine and beckinsale   at least   isn t saddled with another lumbering   clunky screenplay   she s had bad luck   what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume     just an inanely pointless one    serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy   who plays a snarky bloomingdale s salesman    what s the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined   no pun intended   conclusion    serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings   but it only tests our patience    
1921	1	when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called   the postman     i thought     an american version of  il postino      starring costner    god help us      when i found out that it was not a remake of   postino   but an postapocalyptic epic   i thought      landworld      please   god   make him stop      as it turns out     the postman   is a much better film than i had expected    despite being set in 2013   the movie is   at heart   a western   a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers   a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back    the setting   however   allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance   american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars   and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages    the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it    costner s nameless character   a wandering actor   rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem   will patton     a former copy machine salesman turned bandit king    our hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman    taking the uniform and bag of mail   he passes himself off as a representative of   the restored united states      he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets    one young disciple   ford lincoln mercury   larenz tate     organizes a full scale postal service    ford spreads the postman s message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule    as war breaks out between bethlehem s army and the postal workers   costner s character steps into the legend he created and goes from self centered loner to leader of the revolution    his lie of the restored united states becomes a self fulfilling prophecy       postman   is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide eyed optimism   sort of   sergio leone meets frank capra       but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling    what could have been another knock off of   the road warrior     like   waterworld   was   surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble    tate is the stand out in the movie s large cast    ford lincoln mercury   self named   is the polar opposite of o dog   tate s character in his debut film     menace ii society     1993     and tate makes ford s innocent belief in hope as convincing as o dog s cynicism and brutality    his performance sells the movie    interestingly   as tate moves from his usual street smart roles to youthful optimism   the soft eyed patton   who usually plays nice guys   proves a disarming villain    olivia williams makes her film debut as the postman s love interest   abby    when they first meet   abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile    predictably   the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits   and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero    however   their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored   she   torn by grief   guilt   and anger   he   resisting his destiny         the postman   is costner s best work thus far    perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future            
1607	1	i ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges   but i loved him in the big lebowski    the part of jeff   the dude   lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind   and the fit is perfect    the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles   a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians    he s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes    after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy   but not before they urinate on his rug    the dude assumes that these   collection agents   were after another jeff lebowski   a famous millionaire who also lives in l   a   so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug    the millionaire refuses   but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped    he wants the dude to act as go between for the kidnapers    dude and his friend walter   john goodman   take on the task   and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers   millionaires   high schoolers   nihilists   artists   pornographers   thugs   and league bowlers    comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres   so take my recommendation as you will   for me   the big lebowski is very funny    it is an incredibly successful comedy   the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films    not only are the two leads   bridges and goodman   funny separately and together   but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure    all the characters end up as the butt of jokes   but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived    each person may be a comic caricature   but there is always a respectful self acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension    the characters are firmly established   and they never change their behavior for a quick   cheap laugh    it s not what they do that s funny   it s who they are   which is why the acting is so important   and so successful   in this movie    worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus   that s jee zus   not hay soos     the greaser bowler who s in a lusty marriage with the game   julianne moore as the post post feminist artist whose work has been described as   vaginal     steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter   and sam elliott as the rambling   long winded narrator    aside from the performances   what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue    people lose trains of thought   they interrupt   they boast   they repeat themselves   they repeat their friends        they sound natural    taken with fargo   the coen brothers  last film   it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers    ethan coen is not just good at directing actors   he s also good at technical directing    he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film    perhaps   beautiful   is the wrong word   nihilists   carpet pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty    but the bowling photography and a series of viking bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed   as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film    all around   the big lebowski is great   solid comedy    outstanding acting   writing   direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success    
1515	1	when i first heard that romeo   juliet had been   updated   i shuddered    i thought that yet another of shakespeare s classics had been destroyed    fortunately   i was wrong    baz luhrman has directed an   in your face     and visually stunning piece with this film    it revolves around the two rival families   who in this version each run multi million dollar enterprises    these rival companies families are the capulet s and the montague s    the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs   who despise one another    as the storylines goes   romeo montague   played by leonardo dicaprio   and juliet capulet   claire danes   meet at a fancy dress party   and it is love at first site    i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film   the scene in which romeo s eyes meet juliet s through the fish tank is one of the most memorable    of course   they cannot publicly reveal their love   for their families are arch enemies    so they marry in secret   this is where things begin to go wrong    the story   as with all good shakespeare   ends in tragedy    the cinematography is spectacular to say the least   and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which to   lay our scene     as the film says    there is very little to criticise    the performances are convincing   and several of the film s younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers    the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever    despite the well known storyline   this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience   especially the younger generation     and this is certainly a great credit to the film    
1566	1	metro i ve seen san francisco in movies many times    there was 1994 s interview with the vampire and most recently the rock    now   yet again   san francisco is the setting for this movie    eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd   he is their top hostage negotiator   and the very best at what he does    when his best friend on the force is killed by joe   michael wincott   in a terrific performance     a psychotic   demented jewel thief   roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again    meanwhile   roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex girlfriend veronica   while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who s an expert sniper and marksman   michael rappaport      despite the obligatory cop movie scenes   does every cop new partner movie have to start the same way      where the sgt    assigns roper a partner   roper confronts the sarge   etc     this film is still one heck of an explosive ride    a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed   and boasts some amazing car stunts    eddie murphy shines in this tailor made role   and for once   his character shows depth and concern    when confronting joe in prison   you can feel the anger drip from every word    michael rappaport is basically throwaway    he serves no purpose   except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day    typical action escapist fare    michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe    never before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously    maybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott s perfectly raspy voice    i don t know    what i do know   though   is that although metro is basically a typical action retread   it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches     the film is a triumph   and an entertaining one at that    it doesn t meander or trail off from its main character    an enjoyable two hours   metro is enjoyable   witty   action packed   and fun   and makes for a great action movie that s perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality    
247	0	as bad as   mimic   was   it definitly scared me       mimic   continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style   and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie    director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film   cronos      that movie worked because it took an unconventional story   unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie    in   mimic     del toro doesn t bother to give us anything original    the plot is a stupid combination of   aliens   meets   species   meets   jurassic park      the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies    there s nothing new in   mimic      it s just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work    at the end of the movie   you re stuck wanting your money back    maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies   he forgot to turn the lights on    i don t understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the   seven   trend and be set in dark   dank areas    watching   mimic   i was tempted several times to yell at the screen   turn the lights on    the switch is to your right    use common sense    just do it    you ll be able to see the monster in the corner      there s a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off    it looked like the light operator was having a seizure   and sorvino didn t even notice   she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts       hmmm          i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight         mimic   has a lot of incidental shock tactics   boo    just kidding     and follows them up with the real scare   but nothing in this movie scares you    the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments   i think they were bored   too    i shouldn t blame del toro    he isn t the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie    hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time     the killer   and   hard boiled   then came to america to make the stupid   broken arrow      french directors luc besson     la femme nikita     and george sluizer     the vanishing     followed woo s lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies    robert rodriguez   who directed the terrific low budget   el mariachi   came to hollywood and directed the horrible   high budget   desperado      i don t know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can t make a good american movie    woo finally broke through and made   face off     but it still isn t up to par with his earlier films    i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office   chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director     welcome to america    i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long    do you speak english    now   i know you think you ve made good movies in the past   but now you re in america   so things are a little different here    just remember what the american audience always wants   and you ll be fine    they want to see at least one big breasted woman   characters that they ve seen a thousand times before   because change scares americans     and you always need a cheesy feel good ending to wrap things up    if you don t make that kind of movie   you ll be shining my shoes in no time      
304	0	the tagline for this film is     some houses are just born bad      so i didn t expect too much from this    but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre    i thought   liam neeson   cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont    i thought   mabe it will be fun    and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing    but by the end of it i thought   why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones   jan de bont      these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality    here is the story   in the monstrously over decorated mansion known as hill house   visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor   liam neeson   into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation    among them is a sophisticated bisexual   cathrine zeta jones     a cynical dope   owen wilson   and a gentle and emotional lady   lily taylor      actually   the doctor is researching the   primordial fear reaction   and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch    what happens    but he gets unexpected help from the house itself    it rumbles   hums and belches forth remarkable sights    portals become veiny stained glass eyeballs    a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth    filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains    but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real   placing an emotional wall between audience and screen    the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture    is that exciting or what    the worst thing about it is that it didn t have to be bad    it s based on a great book     the haunting of hill house      by shirley jackson    a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent    it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience       the blair witch project     that cost less than an old car   managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses    and with a  70 mill    budget   de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror    de    bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is   in itself   frightening    he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush    but why give him a more serious material    in the end   haunting   will only haunt its fledgling studio   dream works skg   and de bont s career as a director    yet it wouldn t be fair to say that everything is bad    the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated    beautiful   mysterious   magical and spooky    but this is where the good things end    the music is blaring   the floors moving   the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming    and all of this   every second   every moment of screen time   is absolutely without life    it s nothing more than a special effects extravaganza   visually impressive   but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn t engage    at first you do not know what s going on    is this part of the experiment    are these hallucinations    projections of the subconscience    paranoia    but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening    the house is actually possessed    it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window    for ever   i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that s what i got    i believe hichock once said that   it s    better to wait for a climax   than to see one      this may be true   and it might actually work   but there is only one problem    jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary   only stupid    they are impossible to take seriously    any paralells that you might have heard before   linking this picture to kubrick s   the shining     are absolutely baseless       shining   had class   style   story   acting   but most of all talent and originality       haunting   has only special effects and art direction to boast of    and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film    casting good actors for small   pale parts only makes things worse    but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write   most of you will see this film anyway   even if the tagline would say     some films are just born stupid      
1225	1	because the press screening of   planet of the apes   was one day past last issue s deadline   i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time   listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece    the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance   that the story was thin   that mark wahlberg s character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked    to those people i would like to say   what the hell did you expect    this is a tim burton movie   boys and girls    tim burton movies have great art direction and thin   clunky stories    for the blissfully nasty   disjointed and underrated   mars attacks         jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie   burton reportedly tossed vintage   mars attacks      trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up    burton s re imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great    the apes   courtesy of make up magician rick baker   are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold    like astronaut leo davidson   wahlberg     the film hits the ground running   whisking viewers through a head spinning series of solid one liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later    as for wahlberg   consider what burton does with his character    from his start as a filmmaker   burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits   pee wee herman   the joker   ed wood   the ack acking martians   etc     and lack of interest in standard issue heroes    so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders    as for lack of color   remember   leo only launches into space to get his monkey back    he doesn t want to lead humanity and he isn t looking for romance from a pretty   but dull human   estella warren   or a dynamic ape   helena bonham carter   terrific as an equal rights activist      as a man who just wants out   wahlberg is focused   subtle and sly    the surprise ending provides the requisite shock   and some more dandy visuals   particularly of the approaching authority figures     but admittedly isn t nearly as satisfying as the one in the original    for the original ending to work   we only had to make one simple connection   for this one   we have to write a whole new screenplay    the 1968   apes   boasted a handful of great scenes   cool looking monkeys   a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston   who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed   re delivering a classic line   and a killer ending    but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball    the 2001   planet of the apes   offers a different set of great scenes   much cooler looking monkeys   fine acting from wahlberg   bonham carter   paul giamatti and tim roth   and a not so good ending    it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that s nothing to complain about

1579	1	it stands as a moment one will not soon forget   a giant   green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale   narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds    this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek   dreamworks  second computer animated feature   but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema   a page of this tale serves as that ogre s toilet paper    from this opening moment   one can infer shrek s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard   disney esque fairy tale    although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek   the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship   courage   and acceptance   excelled by outstanding direction   stunning actor voice work   and most importantly   a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye    while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults   positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline   shrek   the previously mentioned ogre   holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community    the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider   known only as the donkey   his species   who talks   and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time   shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world    the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad   learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way    their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on   exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone    shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey    courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines   along the journey to rescue fiona   donkey s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself    whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone   donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self acknowledgment    but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant   fire breathing dragon guarding fiona   either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage    he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him   allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them    secondly   upon shrek s and donkey s redeeming of princess fiona   the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her   to satisfy her desire for a   human   knight in shining armor    throughout this storyline   shrek faces his deep   perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona    an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth   but eventually   shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona    children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it   if one sets his her mind to overcoming something in particular   endless possibilities exist    after the friendships and courage prevail   the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development   acceptance    surprisingly   fiona holds a dark secret of her own   due to a spell cast upon her years ago   she transforms into an ogre by night    in this storyline   fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself   and she must realize what beauty truly means   to simply act as one s self    upon fiona s learning of shrek s desire to pursue a relationship with her   fiona   knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work   gives in to her inner demons of self ridicule and hatred    any child can pull from fiona s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self acceptance    on the technical side   shrek triumphs    directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner   evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters    these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers   shrek     eddie murphy   donkey     and cameron diaz   princess fiona      myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other     normal   beings    murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen    cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona   giving the princess ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack    while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek   the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay   written by ted elliott   terry rossio   joe stillman   and roger s   h    schulman    the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer   combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike    capping it off with a constant tongue in cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features   the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers    with shrek   dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come    the smaller children will laugh and cheer   the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not    a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own   shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages

1627	1	one of the best movies i ve ever seen    i d heard extremely good things about this movie   and though the previews didn t really intrigue that much   it was a movie i d been anticipating for a few months now    for some reason i m not sure of   this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u   s   it was a definite hit with the critics   but didn t exactly set any box office records    after viewing this incredibly well directed   written and acted movie   i can t help but wonder   why    the strength of this film is it s gritty realism    the main characters are all human with individual flaws   no stereo type hollywood heroes    you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life   but that is what makes it so real    i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller   but i was mistaken    even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase    and the ending             whoa    i ve never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly    the three male leads   guy pearce   kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific    the  best actor  oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue   but there is one problem there    how could they have chosen between these three actors    there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two    it s impossible    kim bassinger s performance is also a revelation    i d never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was   well       what s the word   a twinky    that impression has changed   as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly    the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding    no cardboard characters here    the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences    pearce s interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant    i really can t fault this movie at all    i was so glad to see fellow australian s pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie    i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films   but had not seen much of guy pearce    i intend to change this next time i visit the video store

1358	1	as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot   mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences    you know the type   his shirt is always shredded   his face always scarred   he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a   to kill   list for his enemies    oscar hungry director executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to   but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century    as gibson delivers lines like     before this war is over   i am going to kill you     schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind    oddly enough   the patriot is as much an epic three hour tear fest like gladiator   as it is a ninety minute guilty pleasure    at times absorbing   at others enjoyably insipid   this is good   bloody summer fun    i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend    some of the images are so zealously americanized   the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example     that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it    like emmerich s id4   this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all    sure it s predictable and melodramatic   but for a moment after leaving the theater   i was dumbfounded with patriotism    and isn t that the point of the patriot    gibson plays benjamin martin   the lionized french and indian war veteran   who   at the beginning of the film   is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away    he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants   not slaves        as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away   martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields    but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel   jason isaacs     martin quickly decides to save the day   or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich      forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war   martin becomes the number one target of the british army    the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right    every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy   to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis    tom wilkinson   face was priceless entertainment    and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time   a final battle is inevitable    as for the numerous battle scenes   they are expertly done    clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator   the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating    you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period    everything is performed in an orderly   but still quite gory   fashion   one side shoots   then the other side   then the remaining soldiers charge    it s organized   strategic and   according to martin   ineffective    there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin s take no prisoners method    what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions   are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington    played wonderfully by jason isaacs   tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians   who nervously avoid eye contact    this character is viciously evil   he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home   even his eyes are evil    his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain   some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as   cowardly   and   sadistic      i disagree with this accusation    tavington does not represent his country   his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general    besides tavington   the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized    and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies   why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys    heck   why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys    the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks    with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down   it s a lethal weapon for the colonial times    god bless america    and god bless the patriot    
1848	1	plot   a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side    but this new guy is not like all the others   he s got ambition   he s got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster    violence   lots of swearing and betrayals ensue    critique   a very good   serious minded   unique british gangster flick which misses the   great   mark by way of an annoying voice over popping up throughout the film and a so so ending    here s yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix    okay   so it s not entirely new   but it s definitely original when all put together as done here    the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place    it s 1968 and these dudes are looking good    yes   it s all about the suits   fellas       the  italian shoes   the cufflinks   the ties and the birds   that s ladies   for those uninitiated   hanging around you    here are a bunch of horrible men   gangsters if you will   looking sharp   talking shit and busting heads all over the place    but that s not the basis of this movie    the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group   the excellent david thewlis   and one of his cronies   paul bettany   also extremely good in this film   and how the power   sex appeal and coolness of one   affects the other    you know how there are always these   hanger on   gangster types who latch on to the godfathers   the leaders   the top dogs of every crime organization    well   most of the time   these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person       that  is   their boss    so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence    but this film brings the betrayals   the messed up loyalties   the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package    of course   director paul mcguigan isn t trying to be guy ritchie here   and doesn t over stylize his presentation   jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix    nope   he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this    the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he s attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty         look into my eyes        in fact   the last time that i ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers  miller s crossing    scary shite    but there s an ever better scene than that in this film    this one features bettany   once again   slowly torturing   hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster   from that man s point of view     but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes   one by one   that s right   he   does   the guy in his underwear      that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film   especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss   why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman        but the flick s not perfect    in fact   i didn t mind malcolm mcdowell s voice over narration at first   but as the film grew into a major flashback   most of the film is presented as such     he came in every now and then   and rarely added anything of interest to the plot    all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c word umpteen times   and even described one scene as it was happening           so  i opened the door   then went up the lift   etc            it s  like   yeah   i know that already   i could see it on the screen      overdone        i also didn t quite   buy   the ending of the movie   which despite being original   seemed a little unbelievable   especially when you consider that it s supposed to be taking place 30 years later   and folks still seem to be holding grudges   still in love   still living in the same apartments          i mean   c mon       it s 30 years   man      i don t know   somehow it didn t work all that well for me    but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies   and this one is a decent addition to the lot    forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell s narration of the obvious plot points   and concentrate on the film s stronger attributes such as its style   the exquisite atmosphere of the time period   its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group   its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads   bettany and thewlis    incidentally   unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below   this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films       it s the real deal    note   this film is packed with strong accents all around   which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time    it s also quite violent and i don t remember any film that used the c word as much as this one   so leave the kids at home for this one              where s joblo coming from    american psycho   10 10     a

29	0	reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger   scream 3 and arlington rd are the others   each derivative in their own special way      the guy can t seem to write believable dialogue   sample from reindeer games     rule  1   never put a car thief behind the wheel       create multi faceted characters   or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns   no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely      his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight    i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard     oh you thought my movie was gonna go here   f   ck you jack ass   take that twist   decipher this mother f   cker      it s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie    and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is    auteur theory be damned   it s kruger s   style     not the director s that winds up on screen    kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut   sometimes less is more      and his numerous twists can t even claim to be originals   arlington rd s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j   pakula thriller the parallax view   and in reindeer games we get this ol  gem   character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn t know   pronouns used to protect the gender of the   character         grammar  be damned         how did you know that      the stunned protagonist asks   suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along            since twist endings are currently so in vogue   and seeing as how kruger s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending   i guess it s no wonder why he works so frequently    he s quickly becoming miramax s mickey mouse   the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects    this is appropriate considering that miramax   which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films   has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports   life is beautiful   and freddie prinze jr   vehicles    their company s current logo could be   we ride the trends      reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy   a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head    although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness   he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick    affleck is such a puppy dog that it s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone s bitch    the role itself is so badly written   the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it     the twists so outrageous   and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent   serious   movie getting    it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction   casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy   who s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance    james frain is nick   rudy s cellmate   a manslaughterer who s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason   charlize theron      ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she s never seen one picture of him    which works out fine since the character is killed in a near riot   and rudy   who was to be paroled on the same day as nick   takes his place   which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy   so frenzied it kinda looks like rape   and a surprise visit from ashley s brother   gabriel   gary sinise     who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co horts    he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who   according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley   used to work as a guard in the indian casino    though by the end   the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i ve described might as well be irrelevant    this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on   several scenes in which   after catching his prey   the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one liner    included   two   2   scenes of two   2   different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him   one following the other no less      though it s an action film   the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on   incredulous as the audience    the flick was directed by john frankenheimer   a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career   fell off the a list following a string of flops and now   in his old age   is slowly climbing his way back up    it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin   one of those almost but not quite movies   which followed the island of dr   morneau     you remember   the one with marlon brando in mime make up and a not so flattering moo moo     and now this    he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain zapped mtv audience to pick apart    problem is these action scenes   nearly all failed escapes   serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play    character problems abound   rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre   the latter of which is not   at least at this point   something ben affleck is capable of pulling off    the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear    but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster    charlize theron   an extraordinary talent   is   like affleck   playing whatever part the script requires her to play   whether it be vulnerability at one moment   anger at the next    she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes   frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this    gary sinise has played this role frequently   and here   as in snake eyes   he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol   the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more     that it becomes more of an annoyance   oh there he goes again         than a threat    these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience    
1809	1	there must be some unwritten rule that states   one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom   even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere    in the exotic morocco of 1972   a 25 year old english hippie mother   julia   winslet     of two sweet young girls   the 6 year old lucy   carrie   and the 8 year old bea   bella     has arrived for a year s stay   with the self absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband   she is not officially married to him   and her cold one room london flat   and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech    at least she says she is   as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers    she has not planned things out too carefully   having no money   and the trip doesn t seem like it s much fun   more like a misadventure   with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in    drugs   a world wide youthful phenomena during this period   where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the  good life  cheaply   and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities   even though drugs are illegal there    but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here    in this film   the subject of drugs is never broached   only hinted at in an off handed but slurring way   as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light   strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken    even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons   to follow the mystical sufis   seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from    the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud s grand daughter   esther freud   who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister    it is written by the director s brother   who has previously directed regeneration   the playboys   and trojan eddie    the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls    with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her   she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria   so instead   she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar   bilal   said taghmaoui      he becomes her lover   taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls    the girls readily accept him   and there is no big to do made about their openly sexual relationship   but the girls really don t know what to make of the relationship    it especially bothers bea   who is embarrassed by her mother s loose attitude and wants to go home    things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village    it seems only that bilal s charm is matched by his shiftlessness   as he has a wife who still lives there    this scene didn t make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation   unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people   also    but i doubt that    the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next   as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel    lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel   while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a  normal  girl    the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet   as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes   expansive views   illustrious mosques   and grand sunsets    kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner   living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences   as many a drop out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose    the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane   provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film    the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn   a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves    the family s travel   which is on the edge   has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting   but   when she gets up   all there is   is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her    that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her   is starting to wear thin in her thoughts    it will dawn on her   when bea takes ill   as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her   whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence    he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him    the new guru is grounded in reality   something she is not grounded in   and seems to tell her what she couldn t comprehend from anyone else   even comforting her   by telling her that her tears are memories  a gift from god    the film s weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor   she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation   and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia    the storyline about a helpless single parent   detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby boom generation had during their trip to morocco   who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism   a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers   contrary to the impression the film might give   seemed to pass her by    her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep   at best    she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along   smoking some hashish   and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey    after all   the mystical trip is the journey    the film s strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are   and no one is that good or that bad   or judged too harshly for their shortcomings    bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity    the little girls are precocious but they are lovable    julia   the cornerstone the film is built on   is a mother who cares about the children but doesn t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them    she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london   she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she s at    this is a very freudian way to look at things   as this sudden realization   that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey   at least   for the time being    and   after all is said and done   who s to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences   just like she probably was

tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases    in america they call this time   summer   and it happens once every year    and maybe it s the exposure to all that nasty sun

  action thrillers     the   this obviously cost a lot so you know  everyone s going to go   explosions   gas threats   flying saucers   and special effects    in the rash of   my   what big guns you have   but wait    mine are bigger   movies   there are also the usual boy meets fish and saves environment movies   or whale   whatever     and   this   year   the odd crop of   save the world from aliens or environment  threats   offerings    i m talking about the three batmans   the speeds   the terminators   etc   this year i m talking about twister   independence day   the arrival   the rock   mission   impossible   and of course   eraser    here in singapore   as our local movie critics like to whine   we seem to get the pick of the crop of   my explosion is more real looking than yours   movies   but nothing else    mission   impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us    the same goes for eraser   which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called   mission   unavoidable     on account of its worldwide mega advertising blitz     eraser seems like a cheaper   less thoughtful imitation    that s saying a lot   because mi the movie was already a cheap   thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the  60s  70s    in eraser   arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger    he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re situating them with new identities    his new case is lee cullen   played by vanessa williams who   unlike all the other scumbags he s ever relocated   is   an actual   real life honest person      because she s so good   and has such nice legs   arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her   and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from   his   killers    lee obtains evidence that the high technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated   black market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair    of course   as the formula goes   her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck   there are people in high places who will go down with this   because yes   this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world   that is   america   since watergate    in protecting lee   arnold is framed by the mentor turned evil robert deguerin   nicely played by james caan   and ends up having to prove that he isn t the one killing the programme s witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn t accidentally torpedo ed to death by the new   green guns his enemies all have    it s around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission   impossible theme   because arnie s mission includes breaking into a high security building to run a disk    i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about    it s an electro magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles   and which can see through walls    it has some sort of x ray vision   so its user can target the victim s heart even from great distances    despite this   which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun   though i m certainly no expert     however   arnold   whose own heart is targeted a number of times     never   goes flying 10 feet backwards with a two foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun    instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time   giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous     i ll be back      like everyone else in the theater   i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me   because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily    although there is a   lot   of violence in this movie   not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators   i recommend this movie to most over 18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas    review s rating system     wait for the video         a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha           pretty good   bring a friend             amazing   potent stuff               perfection    see it twice

747	0	conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children s items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty five or thirty years after the item was made    that s when the kids of that time have jobs   disposable income and a desire to re visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives    check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you ll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks    there s a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen    boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work a day world for a long time    they d like to re capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore    hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them    directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time    and for the most part they re messing it up       mission impossible       lost in space       godzilla       zorro      none of these successfully capture the originals    none of these are even good films    you can now add   the avengers   to the list    the british television series began in 1961    super secret agent john steed   then patrick macnee   and his third partner   emma peel   then diana rigg   are the pair that the american audience fell for    surrealistic and witty   the series fit the mood of the times    the leather clad rigg probably didn t hurt the ratings either    after all it s not a coincidence that you can t pronounce her character s name without   appeal      now we re in the nineties    steed   now ralph fiennes   and peel   now uma thurman   are battling evil genius sir august de wynter   sean connery   who is screwing with england s weather    that s about as much of a plot as we have    there s some footage about a lot of other things that either don t make sense or make even less sense    we get betrayal for some unknown reason    evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film    remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason    there s a high tech hot air balloon   but i have no idea why anyone s in it    the spy agency is run by a man called   mother   who is in a wheelchair and a woman named   father   who is blind       at  least in some scenes    there s probably a reason for all of this   but we ll never know it    macnee makes an appearance of sorts    he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing    a group of villains sits around a table   all clad in huge pastel colored teddy bear outfits    at first it s humorous to watch the teddies waddle around   but then it becomes goofy    the movie is a medley of clutter   confusion and wrong decisions around every corner    it feels like major portions of the film are missing    the storyline jumps rather than flows    reportedly the film was re cut several times    this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing    there s one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher    other than that   the effects are second rate    the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes    thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn t work    she looks good   dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there s no spark    fiennes fares even less well    macnee s steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor    fiennes  agent comes across as a dour kid in grown up clothes who has never been out of his home town    even connery   one of the greatest living actors   doesn t have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes    the action scenes are difficult to follow    director jeremiah chechik   responsible for the atrocious remake of   diabolique     somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn t be    things happen   people move around   but even if   with the utmost effort   you were able to care about any of it   the scenes are bewildering    the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads    witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination    admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film   but there s no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever    one of emma peel s first lines of dialog is   rules are made to be broken      it doesn t get any better    advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone    the release date was changed several times    connery refuses to promote the film    there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers    at least this way   they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out    admittedly i haven t seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades    my guess is that it would be severely dated now    no matter how antiquated it might be   there s no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing    there s no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie    no reason at all    
335	0	as a hot shot defense attorney   kevin lomax   keanu reeves   has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients    he is also an excellent judge of character   knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness s testimony    and   on top of that   he s a damn good trial lawyer    in the opening scene   it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty   but it doesn t hamper lomax s desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt   thereby getting an acquittal    his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country   headed by john milton   al pacino      he is brought to their headquarters in nyc   where he immediately impresses milton   and is subsequently offered a full time position as head of their newly created criminal law division    lomax is soon given the case of his life    he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide    the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell    he works late   defends the guilty   pledges his soul to his firm   and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife   mary ann   charlize theron      but what starts off as a promising john grisham like story about conscience stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story    it begins like a typical parable where a small town boy makes it big   but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money   power   and greed    but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm    quite literally   he is the devil in disguise   and as the movie progresses   he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago    freaky and frightening things begin to happen   and after much of the film has elasped   milton s horrifying intent is finally revealed    the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts    the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big city trial lawyer    the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax    unfortunately   the two never mix well into a cohesive story   and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere    granted   the film is very handsome looking    you ll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino    you ll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties    you ll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann   knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away    this was one of the better storylines   but unfortunately   is only a sub plot    as with all thing s involving the devil   you can expect nothing but the worst    in the first few scenes   reeves anchors the film   but then slowly drifts into the background    his path from self vanity to self consciousness is never fully explored    his actions seem arbitrary   and his reasons for them not fully known    pacino s comical portrayal is spirited   but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie    there is another plot or two that is introduced   but never gets revisited    the focus seemed inconsistent throughout   and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap    this movie tries to be horrifying   thrilling   and dramatic all at the same time    however   while the devil s advocate strives to get noticed   ultimately it makes very little impression at all    
1196	1	it s a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn t need violence to be good or worth watching    all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails    and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo nuclear war    and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon    a computer whiz kid   david   is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades    but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game   he wants to be the first to play it    instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad    with the help of jennifer   a girl in his biology class   he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr   war operation plan response   a top notch computer at the time   but now hardly faster than my own computer    i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema    it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn t changed    of course   a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983    i wouldn t be surprised if this gave people nightmares    i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon    broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers   although her interest in david remains a mystery      but the rest of the actors are   by no fault of their own   restricted by the script to play one dimensional grownups    david s parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s   movies like secret admirer   porky s or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr   strangelove    if for no other reason   you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days    david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers    the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on    far from any 56k modem my guess is that it s some kind of 2400 bps modem   the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum    the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights   just like those you see on star trek or any old sf movie   but it s hardly impressing compared with what you can get today    what are the lessons we can learn from wargames    1    make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers    2   thank you   whoever it was   for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers    
1794	1	john von neumann   progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project   pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos   even without recourse to faster than light travel    you send out self replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information    it may take decades   centuries   or millennia   but it can be done with achievable technology   and doesn t require a magical faster than light drive    in the fifties   british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it   any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer   which would then engage in a real time dialog with the aliens   exchanging information and technologies   and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned    about thirty five years ago   the bbc contracted with astronomer writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini series called a for andromeda    afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission   the construction of a huge computer   the computer s analysis of life on earth   and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication    she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then unknown julie christie    audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel   andromeda breakthrough   which played to equally high ratings    dennis feldman   whose previous credits include the golden child   has never been noted for coherent   well structured movie scripts   they start out great   and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action   mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl    feldman writes good scenes   but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie   even with a previous version to use as a model    now   in species   we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline   derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter   gore   and chases    species features ben kingsley   who is completely wasted in a badly written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist    forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script    the species story is relatively simple   we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971   and have been receiving answers for two years       note that   in the 1970 s   we really didn t know diddly about the human genome structure   and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings    even today   all we can do is give information about dna and how it works   not a copy of human dna   because we don t have it analyzed yet      the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race   and doctor xavier finch   played by ben kingsley   is placed in charge of the attempt    the script begins to go off the deep end at this point   when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape shift into any of several ugly alien life forms    the first half of the film has something to offer   as   sil     the alien girl   struggles with her multi form existence   changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again   all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos    she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society   with glaring gaps where her social skills should be    her instincts are to mate and procreate   and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area    escaping from her birth laboratory in utah   sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her    she goes on an eating binge   spins herself a cocoon   and emerges as an adult   played by natasha henstridge   who goes a long way toward re creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960    the pursuers   michael madsen is an assassin exterminator   forrest whitaker is a convenient empath psychic   just as though the u   s   government actually had such people on call    neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided    whitaker s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek   the next generation s   counselor cleavage      the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina    kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals   too good to not work to the best of their abilities   but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland   and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak    h   r   giger s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it   although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly    the main fault of species is lack of originality   it starts out with a wonderful   albeit borrowed   premise   and then doesn t live up to it    all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes   with a few monsters tossed in    there is no buildup of tension and suspense   no climax worthy of the name   species is just a sequence of   scare   scenes stuck together    the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes   but not rescued by them    on the other hand   as an exercise in sci fi action  adventure   it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd    species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board   but by and large   it s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing    my personal rating is three stars   but knock one or two of those off if you don t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters    mpaa classification   r   violence   gore

1310	1	the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane    billy   played by michael keaton   is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble    christopher lloyd portrays henry   an obsessive compulsive who requires that everything be neat   orderly   on schedule   and by the books    he thinks he s a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports    jack   played by peter boyle   thinks he s jesus    and finally   there s stephen furst as albert   a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases    the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four some when their psychiatrist   dr   weitzman   takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium    during a pit stop   they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan    the movie s charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast    the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively   they never miss an opportunity to argue   bicker   or insult one another    henry and jack   for example   fight over who s going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game    the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other    michael keaton is well cast as billy   he gives his cynical character considerable complexity    as the divinely jack   peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one dimensional character funny and fresh    although stephen furst s catatonic character is cliched   the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing    while keaton   boyle   and furst are good   it s christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special    lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance    his body language   for example   the way he walks   and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character    lloyd s brilliant performance yields a pathetic   moving   and memorable character    the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise    the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot    
1935	1	this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated    there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood s most famous celebrities   some fabulous animation and a compelling story    this is the best we ve seen from disney since   beauty and the beast     1996      this film begins an unspecified time following the happily ever after conclusion to toy story    in the aftermath of their earlier adventures   buzz   voice of tim allen   and woody   voice of tom hanks   are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony   content with their   lives      one day   andy broke woody s arm off   while playing with him    woody is now officially discarged and worthless   left with his nightmares   where he lies in a trash can with the other discards    later andy s mother decides to have a yard sale   and she collects a few old toys from her son s room    since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang   woody goes to the rescue   leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back    although his mission is successful   he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al   voice of wayne knight   spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale    the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series     woody s roundup      if he can acquire woody   al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit    so   after andy s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy   al steals him   and it s up to the other toys   led by buzz   to go into the city to save their friend    and so   buzz   rex   voice of wallace shawn     hamm   voice of john ratzenberger     mr   potatohead   voice of don rickles     and slinky   voice of jim varney     go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend   they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys    there are car chases   gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis   who   by the way   resembles darth vader      meanwhile   woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family   a cowgirl named jessie   voice of joan cusack     a horse named bullseye   and a father figure called the prospector   voice of kelsey grammar      they offer him another life   as a celebrity    a toy in a museum in japan    he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while   before he grows up   and be forgotten   or be admired by children for generations    the problem is   if woody escapes from al s clutches and returns home   they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage    a real effort is made in the technical department    the animation is rich and colorful   with lots of wonderful details   the   cinematography   is also extremely improved since toy story   there are a lot of complicated swings   turns and close ups that really make an impression    lighting and filters are used to create a mood   as in a surprisingly emotional moment   jessie s remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy   the film contains a lot of in side jokes   such as the one about videogames     and entertaining parodies on   jurassic park   and   star wars      the film ends with the   failed takes     the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv    these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film    but what in the end makes   toy story 2   a memorable experience is not the jokes   its multiple parodies or marvelous animation    it is its heart and emotions    the story about the meaning of friendship   love and even life itself    it is not difficult to predict that   toy story 2   would be a huge economical success   but its artistic achievement was unexpected    unexpected because the first film wasn t much more than a demonstration of special effects    but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn t produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs    but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film   making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years    this is a big step away from the ancient laws of disney animation    off course   this is not   antz     it is not as intelligent   this is not a landmark and no masterpiece   but i promise that you ll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have    whether this is the best animated film of the year   i dare not say    my choice would probably be   the iron giant     but   along side with   american pie     this is the comedy of the year    i almost lost my hopes for disney   but   toy story 2   proves that disney hasn t lost their ability to entertain    
427	0	capsule   a ham handed and over underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment   so muddled it doesn t even know what it s really advocating   if anything    a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations   and it s easy to see why   it presents a strong   almost rancorously so   story   it is full of good actors   samuel l   jackson   matthew mcconaughey   sandra bullock   kevin spacey   charles dutton     and it s ostensibly about some important social issue that we re all tangling with    it is not   however   a good movie   and all of the reasons i ve listed above have something to do with why    right from the beginning   the movie is dead set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible    a pair of redneck whites   boozed and drugged out of their minds   kidnap a young black girl   abuse and rape her horribly   and leave her for dead    after their arrest   their father   jackson   takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial    mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer   and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics    the acting is not quite what it should be   given the cast we have    sandra bullock   who is a good actress but not a serious one   looks clueless   spacey s accent switches itself on and off at random   and he s given a totally thankless role to play as well   a role without an iota of depth     and mcconaughey s role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box    the most memorable role is donald sutherland s   and his is a bit part    i always consider it an index of a movie s desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events   and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact    there is one scene    a riot outside the courtroom    that should have created incredible tension   but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this    because the movie doesn t know what it s really about   it   can t   generate any genuine tension   and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting    one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross burners    which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic    i was reminded of the despicable betrayed   which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile   graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention getter    the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes    first of all   the jackson character is not hard to judge   there s no tension in his dilemma    he s self admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail   no matter how moral his crusade    the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him   if he was white   is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie   but it s never developed into an organic component of the story    it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics    another mistake is in motivational logic   by not having the two white thugs arraigned first    or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence   say    we have that much less empathy for jackson s character    i m probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped   we are   automatically   supposed to feel empathy for him   but that s precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible       see the virgin spring for more on that note      is jackson s character then simply insane    that prospect isn t given terribly serious treatment either    one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works   or how lawyers get their information    mcconaughey s character makes an important slipup late in the movie   when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense    how did the prosecution get this information    how come he didn t get it    the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie s way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam bang fashion    this is the biggest problem   the movie isn t about jackson s character   or his dilemma   or this case   or any of its   frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction   characters    it s not ultimately about anything at all   except its stupid geared down plot   which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending    at two and a half hours   the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten   there s endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing   and no writing about the material that should really matter    it s all handwaving    the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded   and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair    it s not easy to make a movie about something    the other day i saw kurosawa s phenomenal rashomon   a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality   or don t      a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i ve seen in a long time    
1202	1	a common complaint amongst film critics is   why aren t there more literate scripts available      quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn t dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content    paul attanasio s script takes what could have been a tepid thriller   the quiz show scandals of the late 50s   and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors    the film is riddled with telling symbols   e   g    a  58 chrysler   a radio announcement of sputnik   but is never heavy handed    deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes   john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script    redford departs from the usually overlight     cable tv quality   sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces    quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years    although i was only 4 years old when the   twenty one   scandal broke   enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford s almost tangible palette    from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants   the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism   of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without   disposable income     before the manifestation of its american dream    the film deftly weaves several themes together   from assimilation and exclusion of jews from   the good life     to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father s fame    though the 50s audience that is   rocked   by this scandal may initially seem naive to us   they should appear all too familiar   with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding    charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day    the tv audience is almost a fourth main character   always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf    at the film s end   the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience   mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff    like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret   this   mirror   may reflect an image we re not all that comfortable with    
1463	1	vampire films   as well as other horror films   are usually dumb and predictable b movies   meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks    it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning   but has also a plot worth making movies about    based on anne rice s novel     interview with a vampire   is a long   dark trip to hell    the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present day san francisco    the camera slowly find particular window    a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness       so you want me to tell you the story of my life        the mysterious man is louis   brad pitt     a two century old vampire   telling his story to a fascinated interviewer   christian slater      his tale opens in 1791 louisiana   just south of new orleans   where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat   tom cruise      given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead   louis chooses the latter   a decision he will forever regret    everlasting life and eternal youth   promised to him by lestat   turn instead into never ending suffering   damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace    louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat   but   to sate his hunger   he must feed   and the blood of animals is not enough    eventually   he pierces the neck of a grief stricken young girl named claudia   kirsten dunst     whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis    for a while   they are one   big   happy family      but all things end   and claudia s growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation    when luis and claudia break loose from lestat   they travel to paris   where the euro vamps santiago   stephen rea   and armand   antonio banderas     who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned    director neil jordan     the crying game     together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere    as the film begins   there is an incredible palette of colors   beautiful sunrises   lush golden fields   green forests   inky blue clouds and blending sun    when luis is   born to darkness     everything suddenly changes to dark velvet   lit only by the silver moonlight    the beautiful production design by dante ferretti   wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re create the multiple historical periods in the film    from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century   to our present days    the casting is likewise good   involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood   ireland and spain    the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective    cruise is energetic   sinister   charismatic   wild and bloodthirsty    cruise s lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance    with alarming swiftness   the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror   as his murderous purpose becomes clear             kill them mercifully   but do it    you are what you are     for  do not doubt   you are a killer      that is how lestat is teaching luis    but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages    brad pitt is equally convincing as the   vampire with a human soul      antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective   but since they play more or less secondary characters   their performances are almost invisible    the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst   who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character    the world is changing around the little child   but she does not    she remains unchangeable   a child for all eternity    only her wise   dark eyes reveal her age    ironically the film s only miss is the script    anne rice s novel is a very interesting read   and her script is rich   colorful and emotional   but it is also tiering and too melancholic   at times resembling a soap opera    claudia             is that what i should do    let you go     my  father   my luis   who made me       who will look after me   my dark angel   when you are gone      luis     everything will be alright        claudia     do you really believe that      and then they hug emotionally    moments like those displayed above and luis  self pity is a bit tiresome    however rice s script is otherwise strong and well structured   bringing up humor and comic episodes   that were more or less hidden in the book    when lestat finds claudia s dead dressmaker   whom she has killed   he cries out     who will make you that dress now    be a little practical         never  in the house      moments like that are both entertaining and appealing    neil jordan s direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity   homosexuality   love and loneliness    his gothic saga is not meant to scare   but to display these issues differently    wrapped up in mystery   his new   original picture brings vampire films to a new height    
997	0	if anything     stigmata   should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close to one another    of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year   it is clearly the worst    i suppose i should have seen this coming    after all     blair witch   thoroughly creeped me out     sixth sense   was mildly spooky   and then   stir of echoes   had its moments   but wasn t anything i d lose sleep over    clearly   the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping    is it then any surprise that   stigmata   is the dullest   most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe i have seen in a long while    no   not really    patricia arquette plays frankie page   a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe trotting mother    as it turns out   the rosary belonged to a recently deceased brazilian priest    the priest s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan   gabriel byrne   because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue    father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs   but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue    his investigation is soon called off   however   when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata   in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ    father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie  s story   considering she s an atheist   but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself   he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on    he eventually begins to suspect that his boss   cardinal houseman   jonathan pryce     is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church    as it turns out   the dead priest had been working on the translation of a   fifth gospel   before they were excommunicated    the new rupert wainwright music video            i mean film   stigmata   is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse    indeed   it would have been good if it were a music video   because it s only interesting for about five minutes    i m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion   double exposure   and extreme close ups   whoaaaaaa             other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and   yes   he has been to film school    his camera trickery is interesting for a little while   but eventually   it becomes headache inducing    what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue   such as it is     with wainwright screaming at the audience     see    look at what i can do    i m an ex cellent dir ect or      maybe then he d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow motion shots of water dripping in reverse   or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying   ooh   scary        if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery   i didn t see it    just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story   here comes a double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever    arrrrrrrghhhh            then again   the superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother me if   stigmata   had a story or characters that were remotely engaging    though wainwright s vanity certainly doesn t help   he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script    where are plot continuity and character development when you need them    case in point   frankie page is the character that   i assume   we are supposed to identify and sympathize with   but we aren t given any back story on her character   or any reason to like her    the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard working hairdresser   who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building   and she s kind of cute   so let s start the bleeding    the fact that she s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn t help   either    according to frankie page   what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back    go clubbing    sure   that makes sense    arquette   byrne   and pryce give it the old college try   but their characters are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking    scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat   because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable    even though frankie page s life is falling apart before her very eyes   she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon    even more curiously   he seems to be interested in her advances    father andrew s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic    as for pryce   he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle     i ll get you   my pretty     for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded    trust me   i m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain    what s worse   after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats   we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction   veers off in another   then another   and ends up being totally incomprehensible    first of all   the film doesn t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details   how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary    how come an atheist like her was chosen   since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata    actually   i m not sure what frankie was posessed by    supposedly   stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit   but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest   and later by some evil spirit   i think      which one is it    the answer to this question   of course   is very simple   the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr   wainwright wants to use this time    furthermore   the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap up   and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church    if you do any research at all about the gospel of st   thomas   you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church   as the film seems to claim     but that it is readily available at your local library    there s nothing the catholics need to worry about   though       stigmata s   religion is so off base that it can t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church    if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters   they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns   which would have been far more interesting    i m not catholic   in fact   i don  t care much for the catholic church   but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means    it s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as   stigmata   does    it  s not thought provoking   though it would like to be   and it is definitely not scary   though it pretends to be    i m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film   because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story    maybe it s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever    the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over   and over   and over    like so many films of the mtv generation   this one suffers from overkill    so much is overdone in   stigmata     that it eventually has no effect on the audience   leaving us to pick out the film s   many   flaws    i m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st   thomas is so earth shattering    when we finally hear it   the saying sounds like something every five year old

1071	1	stendhal s syndrome   a condition where   in the presence of art   a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression   suicidal behaviour and personality disorder    grim stuff   to be sure   but the subject of a remarkable film from italy s master of the horror thriller dario argento    boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone   the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento    it follows his disappointing american debut trauma   1992     the patchy opera   1987   and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980 s    based on the novel by graziella magherini   the film stars argento s daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist killer    visiting florence to follow up several leads   she is lured by the killer alfredo   thomas kretschmann   to an art gallery   a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail    at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints    posing as a bystander   alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer   a strange game of cat and mouse begins    a gripping story evolves   and a coherent one   too   which may surprise those familiar with argento s often lumpy narratives    the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop hunting killer scenario    it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character s psychological disintegration    the script explores its psycho sexual themes with intelligence and candour   perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers    but as dark as its themes are   the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years    argento is once again working in his native italy   and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences    effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here   and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent    the film s opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination   flashback and real time with tremendous style    proof that   at his most inspired   argento remains one of the world s most exhilarating filmmakers    the cast is generally good   though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless    asia argento s performance is by turns risky   awkward and fascinating    it s a difficult role   and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts    thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo   and marco leonardi   of cinema paradiso   and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy   does okay as anna s work colleague and increasingly confused love interest    but perhaps the stendhal syndrome s single most striking element is ennio morricone s soundtrack    active since the 1960 s   morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts    it s mostly a variation on the one theme   a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary   haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards    it s been three decades since argento and morricone worked together    this is a long welcome reunion    if the film has a fault   it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn t quite reach a completely satisfying climax    but by the closing scenes   the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento s career       note   see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can    dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web

908	0	writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard    harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun    harder than building a bridge over troubled waters    and incidentally   a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review    thrillers are all variations on a theme    you have a smart   resourceful   and powerful bad guy   who has a goal he has to meet    you have a noble and brave good guy   who has to protect the innocent   kill the bad guy   and not get killed himself in the process    the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner    this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest   high noon   or silence of the lambs   or big summer blockbusters like men in black   the fugitive   or air force one   or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds   event horizon   kull the conqueror          is anyone else getting depressed here    point is   it s not enough to follow the formula    you ve got to throw in something extra   something good and new and better than the last version    something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals    this is a hard thing to do   but it is absolutely necessary in every way    without that something extra    whether it s a great plot or a well written screenplay   or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs    the movie fails    that s why the jackal   with all its starpower   with all its budget   with all its hype   gets a big fat f    bruce willis is the bad guy   the jackal   a legendary killer for hire    richard gere is the good guy   a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal    the jackal is trying to kill someone    gere is trying to stop him    will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal       i ll give you three guesses   and the first two don t count      there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal   no moment when you say to yourself     i wonder what happens next      the script for the jackal isn t ripped straight from today s headlines    it s ripped off   straight from an episode of millennium    throughout the movie   we learn what the jackal s plans are and how he intends to accomplish them    no surprise    the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal s plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy    instead   we get two   count  em   two   scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal s plan just as if he s frank black   or more likely   just as if he s been handed a copy of the script      and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight    it s like gere s character is psychic   but neither he nor the fbi   or the screenwriters   seem to know it    and just like in millennium   the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about   whether or not they are important to what he s trying to do or not    what s more   in the last half of the movie   the jackal   supposedly a super smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake   comes down with a major case of the stupids    as for the performances        bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack   which is a major achievement   but not enough reason to see the movie    his disguises are good   but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer s in the saint    richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent   which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance    sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie    not that his performance is bad or anything   it s not   but it is sad that hollywood won t use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent   shoot to kill   sneakers      writing a good plot and a good screenplay   like i said   is hard   but it can be done    it wasn t done here    it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones    do not go see this movie    you ll only encourage the producers to make more just like it    instead   stay home and rent day of the jackal   or in the line of fire   or a fire safety video   for crying out loud    anything other than the jackal   which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other   better movies

763	0	weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg s reliance on formulas    saving private ryan  is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches    there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics    spielberg s greatest strength as a director is the polished   formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story    but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war   or the holocaust   this technique backfires   for it creates coherent   comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size   complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken    in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films     saving private ryan  tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a   pr mission   to pull a young man   ryan   whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere   out of combat on the normandy front just after d day    ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers    the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france    there s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie    the equipment   uniforms and weapons are superbly done    the opening sequence   in which captain miller   tom hanks   leads his men onto omaha beach   is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat    another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences   such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers   the banality of death in combat   the routine foul ups in the execution of the war   and the cynicism of the troops    the technical side of the film is peerless   as always    the camera work is magnificent   the pacing perfect   the sets convincing   the directing without flaw    hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance   which was utterly convincing   and the supporting cast was excellent   though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel    yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events    it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film   or the story fails to convince    throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices   exception   men are shown burning to death with relative frequency      for example   we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground    here and there men lose limbs   in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety   there s an explosion   and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man    but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact    there are no shoes with only feet in them   no limbs scattered everywhere   no torsos without limbs   no charred corpses   and most importantly   all corpses have heads   in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds      the relentless dehumanization of the war   in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity   is soft pedaled in the film    ultimately    saving private ryan  bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war    rather than saying  saving private ryan  is   realistic     it would be better to describe it as   having realistic moments      another aspect of the   hollywoodization   of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular   the lack of swearing    anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war   such as fussell s superb  wartime   understanding and behavior in the second world war    which has an extensive discussion on swearing     knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup       who is this private ryan that we have to die for him      asks one infantrymen in the group of eight    rendered in wartime demotic   that should have been expressed as   who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him      or some variant thereof    conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the   f   word   and largely about   the search for   food and sex    this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an   r   rating due to violence   so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film    however   the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic    the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg    he cannot just cede control to the material   he has to be bigger than it    as if afraid to let the viewer find their own   perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear   emotional foothold in the material   spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had   the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary   reminscent of the closing scene from  schindler s list     the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close   every bit as bad as schindler s monologue about how his car   tiepin or ring could have saved another jew     quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson   captain miller s last words to private ryan   and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain    that particular subplot is so hokey   so predictable   it nigh on ruins the film    nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness   stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat   imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage      because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii    saving private ryan  can only pan for small truths in the shallows        
795	0	this is the worst movie i ve viewed so far in 98    the avengers   silly   man dressed in a bowler hat   woman wearing tight leathers   evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits   greater evil   sir august de wynter wearing kilt    the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast    the same question was probably asked of last year s stinker batman and robin    i feel the production got a little too smug   the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie    my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed   thurman and fiennes     something that was a vital element of the 60 s tv serial of the same name    the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks   but does not allow much room for character development and interaction   except to perhaps grate on the viewer s nerves    one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality    connery as sir august   does not fair better than thurman or fiennes    his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather   mostly embarrassing and poor quality    if there is a movie you would prefer never to see   i believe the avengers would be a good choice    for one thing   you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title    i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released   but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature   like lightning you can t see it coming until it hits you    
1491	1	in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies   payback was better than conspiracy theory   but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon    in other words   it s a decent couple of hours of entertainment   but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson s greatest hits   payback probably won t be on it    gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll    mel s partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt    so he puts a couple of bullets in mel   leaving him for dead   and goes on to pay off his creditors    but   mel isn t dead   it would be a real short movie if he was   and he certainly isn t happy    to make matters worse   he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat    his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters   so mel goes after the mob to get it back    payback is often a very violent film    to its credit   there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic   but the director   i m not sure which one    more about that in a second   made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films    the film appears a bit disjointed in places   which is understandable considering producer   star gibson wasn t thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re shot    when the director refused   another one was brought in to do the re shoot    so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original   although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake   it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end    it s always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain   unless that person has some redeeming qualities    in this case   gibson s character has few redeeming qualities    but hey   its mel   so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him    my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role   the audience would not be quite as responsive    gibson is gibson   whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer   he does a good job    he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance    this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast   including maria bello   as his love interest     william devane and kris kristofferson   as mod bosses      the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn t have a real big part is james coburn   as yet another mobster      if i had one big disappointment in this film   it would be that coburn didn t have a bigger role    in the end   payback is a fairly solid action thriller   just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson s other work

1384	1	pulp fiction   quentin tarantino s anxiously awaited and superb follow up to reservoir dogs   is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about   loved   and hated films of all time    in all fairness   it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it    as if reservoir dogs wasn t perfect   tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction   a fast paced   hard talking   roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way    every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor    to begin with   the two hit men   vincent vega   john travolta   and jules winnfield   samuel l   jackson      these two characters work together perfectly   and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect    travolta   in fact   is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role    if these two characters were not enough   there s the struggling boxer butch coolidge   bruce willis     the two small time criminals pumpkin   tim roth   and honey bunny   amanda plummer     the big man in charge marsellus wallace   ving rhames   and his attractive young wife mia   uma thurman     and the   problem solver   himself   the wolf   harvey keitel      these are just the major characters    smaller roles   but equally terrific   are handed to jimmie   quentin tarantino     a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business   lance   eric stoltz     the far out drug dealer   as well as maynard   duane whitaker   and zed   peter greene     two hillbillies who are the men   behind     no pun intended for those of you who have seen this   a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film    the film interweaves three stories that   at first   seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other    the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold ups    the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop   unknowing of what lies ahead    after this   the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle    utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue   the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants    the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss   marsellus wallace    after basically toying with the men   especially the unfortunate brett   frank whaley     vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase    this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a   357     hand cannon     shooting at the two gangsters    he somehow completely misses them   leading jules to cite divine intervention    this is also the basis for more of the now famous tarantino dialogue    the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades    butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight   but when he does not   marsellus vows to find him   wherever he is   and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune    vincent   meanwhile   has the honor of taking marsellus  wife   mia   out on a date while the big man is out of town    vincent   obviously   is rather nervous about this   especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage    after their date   which seems to rather smoothly   things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent s high priced heroin   dubbed a   monster   by lance    each story continually progresses   and new and amazing events occur    eventually   the stories all meet each other in the end   with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant   which happens to contain both vincent and jules    pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade   and possibly of all time    along with its superb dialogue   action   writing   directing   and acting   this film will not only latch onto you   but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you    and with most fans of this movie   this is proved to be a rather easy task   although at times the graphic images   violence   and language may seem a bit overpowering    surely   quentin tarantino s fame was greatly escalated by this film   and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon    
291	0	i ve heard it called   jaws with claws   and that s a fair summation of the plot   though that tag line does little to quantify quality    director stephen hopkins   blown away   predator 2   and screenwriter william goldman   maverick   misery   would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature   based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century    they ve stacked the deck with two big stars   val kilmer   michael douglas     a bigger production design   beautiful photography   by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond     and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music    the movie doesn t make a lick of sense   though   either as an epic or as your basic boo fest    in fact   some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you ve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000   the movie    how about the three guys with rifles   who trap a lion and then can t even hit the damned thing    or the ham on wry acting of michael douglas   who chews more scenery than the animals ever do      or   my favorite   lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops        
309	0	this is an adaptation of h   g   wells  acclaimed novel  the invisible man     the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue    the director is paul verhoven    that   plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer   should be enough to lure us into the theatre    the problem is to keep us there    i can t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time    working on a top secret military project   sebastian caine   kevin beacon      an eccentric genius   that calls himself   god     has discovered the secret to invisibility    the first two faces are completed    now   it is time for   the next logical step      human    caine volunteers for this risky experiment    but when he is made invisible   something goes wrong    while his ex girlfriend linda   elisabeth shue   desperately tries to find something to return him to normal   he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower    but that s not the bad thing    an unexpected side effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania    he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers   just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine    soon every sense of decency is forgotten    the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien rip off   where caine is walking like a half finished terminator   spooking   scaring and killing everybody    though it s based on a novel called  the invisible man    the title has been ironically changed to  hollow man  that sums up the film very nicely    this is a very silly production    laughable   actually    apparently verhoven s imagination doesn t stretch too far    for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls  locker room undetected    it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie    being invisible   gives you the opportunity to be who you are   to do what you want without being influenced by society    in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences    the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about    all that   the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat    caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man    but since this is a modernization   in other words a dehumanization   he doesn t stop there    he becomes a rapist    and then   of course   a murderer    you ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place    shue s talent is barely seen   josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent    kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully    his face is not seen for the most part of the film   and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice    there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing    in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place    being probably the best technical achievement since   jurassic park     they are absolutely amazing    we observe the layers of skin   muscle   tissue   and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible    we see a beating heart   inflating lungs   and veins pulsing with newly pumped blood    there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke   fire   air and water   but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for    what is truly disturbing is that with a great book   talented actors and a grand budget   this could have been so much more    pretty much like jan de bont     twister       haunting       paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary    he was responsible for several good films     basic instinct   and   starship troopers     and some incredibly bad films     showgirls       total recall       but he has never made anything that was great    in a way   hollow man   fits perfectly in this collection    it s not better or worse than verhoven s average film    he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues    and so   instead of depth and chills   verhoven inserts some of his trademarks   stupid dialogue   and lot s of dull action with blood and naked bodies    he even throws in some of the worst of film clich   s   the slowly advancing fireball   the villain who comes back from the dead   etc   etc     and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year   you ll be screaming   nooooo      and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion      and all we can ask is why    the answer is simple    though hollywood is a movie producing machine   the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money    it has to be about telling stories   not marketing them    it has to be about transporting us to a different place   to dazzle us with magic and cleverness    to make us care   to make us think and feel    verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that    it s all flesh and bones   but no soul    a void where its imagination should be    
1993	1	i don t box with kid gloves    i don t play nice   i m not a nice guy   and i never   ever   go easy on a film    i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic    however   i do some favors   and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery    rigormortis   the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking   gets several of these points each time    i still   however   will not go easy on them    they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy   which begins   quite wittily   with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film     and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it    in the famous lines of many martyrs   i have no regrets    well   i do have some regrets   but that is not the point in the previous sentence    the point of it was that down with america was a film that   from a critical standpoint   did not entirely disappoint me    sure   the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain   and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films   but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable    down with america concerns a government agent   needless murder   and a book containing everything from the unabomber s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report    like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed   it displays an off kilter humor and intelligence   it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail    the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s    a dying movement from the day they started   these paranoid  thrillers  had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word    roswell      in down with america   the line  roswell  is highly absent    with an about ten minute running time   down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich   that the conspiracy films fell into   makes jokes at them at the same time   and provides us with funny and memorable characters    again   i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn t care less about    the film   as previously stated   concerns a federal agent   peter roach     an obsessed librarian   meri stevens     a mystery man   joe kaczkowski     and two people obsessed with silence in the library   robb sherman   kevin flowers      the plot   a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in   a public library where it can be viewed by all    from there we go into a delightful parody    the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth   the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books    we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast    although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to  no name    it ends up being the no name people who do a good job   delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out    for once   i don t have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online    i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l auto and les x files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself    it s almost as much fun as the film

1375	1	taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking   go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers    the story centres around a group of people   who include brit simon   askew     and checkout girls claire   holmes   and ronna   polley   and the misadventures that they get into   split into three chapters    everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers    although qt s touch is evident in nearly every frame   go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride    liman   who also photographed the film   has a deft touch with the camera   and the film looks good    the film also seems to have benefited from a budget   with the night club scenes in particular looking pretty good    there s a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk    the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life    holmes   one of the dawson s creek cast   a show i m not particularly fond of   displays much talent here   and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature    askew is slightly successful   being rather obnoxious    no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him   but instead of  funny annoying  he s just annoying    he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters   but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it    the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl   her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining    also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer   who gives an nice evil performance    the script   written john august   is sharp and witty   with good dialogue and some funny jokes    it starts off rather slow however   but in about twenty minutes the script has found it s footing and just keeps getting better    the stories are largely satisfying   although occasionally there s too much attention on one detail but not on another    also   some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky    still   the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it    it could of tried a little harder in some parts however   and these parts lag    because this is a gen xer movie   the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany   and go s one is pretty decent    unlike other gen xers movies   go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue   which is a plus    go is a very easy movie to absorb into   and the audience really starts feeling for these characters    thankfully   they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics   like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you      they are who they are and they stay that way    go is great fun   and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers    ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things   and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride    erm   go to go   i guess    
7	0	capsule   in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace    there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise    john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films   especially assault on precinct 13   that the new film comes off as his homage to himself       0    4 to  4      john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes    for a writer and director of horror films   supposedly an expert on horror   it is a very bad mistake to make    ghosts of mars is called a horror movie   but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low powered alien menace    in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars   carpenter would have grounds to sue    this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13   the thing   and prince of darkness    it is   in fact   surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way    but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience    ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176    mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear   which is good for the film s budget      it is never mentioned   but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth normal   again making it easier to film    society has changed a bit by that time   but it has advanced surprisingly little    apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control    and from carpenter s view   women have really made a mess of things    society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten    the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9   yes   precinct 9   has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony    instead of having the criminal   napolean   wilson   this film has the criminal   desolation   williams    instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face   well   ghosts of mars    because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner   but they essentially behave as human savages   in another lapse of imagination    the story is told in flashback   flashback within flashback   and flashback within flashback within flashback    ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red   yellow   and black    carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene   showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat    sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup    the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss    his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring    these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience    somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights    within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars   red planet   and ghosts of mars    after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by    i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to  4 scale    following the movie i showed my wife   who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did   carpenter s classic assault on precinct 13    her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice    
1546	1	no matter what you suspect   this isn t your usual action thriller    the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up and coming director bryan singer    it s one of those movies that   after everything is revealed rapid fire at the end   you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light    plot twists a go go are what you get here    i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me    keyser soze is a name you ll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason    it s not only the name of the mysterious   and possibly even mythical   crime boss in the movie   it also sums up the movie      keyser soze   in latin means   an intelligent crime mystery story from up and coming director bryan singer      or maybe i shouldn t have bought a foreign language dictionary from the same company that makes those 99 cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets    at the movie s opening   a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup   including mcmanus   stephen baldwin     keaton   gabriel byrne     fenster   benicio del toro     buckney   kevin pollack   and verbal   kevin spacey   winner of the best supporting actor academy award symbol 153   f   times new roman     s 10   h  for his performance in the movie      verbal is so named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing    he also earns his name as the movie s narrator   spouting memorable lines like   the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn t exist     although   obviously   he does exist    what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996     while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri   any actor with multiple z s in their name is okay in my book      we see the story unfold as spacey retells it    the five felons   upon being released from the lineup   get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service    whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars    and stealing all the money and drugs in the car    it s a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals   who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze   who sends a minion to them with an offer they can t refuse    namely   they have to destroy soze s main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship   shooting a bunch of people   burning all the drugs and stealing  91 million cash    spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent   cripple   character to life and baldwin   byrne   palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast    the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense   keeping the viewer guessing until the very end    and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion    i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv    a different mystery   i guess   which may turn into a  murder  mystery if that video ever comes on again        
1440	1	   seven   is one of the best mystery movies i ve ever seen    it s extremely intriguing and suspenseful   but it s also quite fun    it s a serial killer mystery   but you don t care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer    the story is a cops on the trail of serial killer mystery    someone is murdering people who are offenders of   the seven deadly sins      a fat man   gluttony   was forced to eat himself to death   a lawyer   greed   is slaughtered by his own rich possessions        i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much    what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the   good guys   which makes the unseen villain seem so vile    brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills   the cocky rookie    however   morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset   the wise veteran on the verge of retirement   and he doesn t get killed by the end      there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief    this is impressive because the mood is so tense   and the fact that it can be down played as well as it is here   let alone at all   is quite an accomplishment    the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil   scary place many believe it to be    the production design is superb   in the spirit of   batman   and   the crow     this film embodies the gothic mood    the way the words fade in and out   along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level   even the credits are scary    the killer s victims have no connections at all   and thus mills and sommerset don t have much to go on to solve the case    they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense    we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown    not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this    the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect    let s just say it seems a little too   mystery movie     or too convenient in other words    when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe   a terrific chase scene ensues    this is a typical thrilling element   but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story    if anything   this film is the epitome of twist endings    i don t have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal   but the way in which this happens is surprising    there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives   and even though he s obviously insane   his charisma makes for some good points    what s even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film s resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is       seven   is not just a film about crime   but about the evil within man    john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of   scum      but as justified as he makes himself seem   we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice

533	0	i have never been so confused after watching a movie       meet joe black   is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year   with a cinematography   music and cast that will dazzle most of us    at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season    at first you marvel at the elegant direction   graceful cinematography and sensual musical score    then you ll wait for something to happen for half an hour   but when you finally understand what s going on   you ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins   brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this    the script is simply a silly and unresolved story   which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture    it feels like an eternity    most of the time it is a pompous soap opera   filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and   meaningful   winks    the film is based on alberto caesella s play   death takes a holiday      the story concentrates around bill   anthony hopkins   who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man   but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying   yes      soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen   brad pitt   who introduces himself as   death      it is bill s time    but death has other plans    it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive    our bill is chosen to be death s guide and in exchange he gets time    bill introduces death as joe black   who immediately becomes the center of everyone s attention    bill s business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill s side   lives in his house and resides at his office    that is not all   however    bill s youngest daughter susan   claire forlani   falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her    this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences    it wouldn t be fair to say that this film didn t have some interesting moments   such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill s family for dinner    when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love   the experience is somewhat different    it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure    it s one thing to say     wouldn t it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth        to create a motion picture out of this is another    four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic    it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film    on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest     scent of a woman        hopkins looks great in any role   and no matter how shallow or hollow it is   he will complete it    his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else   since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment    but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time    how can you play death in human form    to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters    they are not creatures   but phenomenas    saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form    handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work    speaking in a calm   soft voice   portraying death as a lonely   distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters    he looks and acts more like an angel of death   rather than a demon or a red eyed executioner    claire forlani and others are also fine   stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits    unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery    in other words this is not what i expected from the director of   scent of a woman      it could   and should   be better with such cast and crew    in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera    
176	0	starship troopers is a bad movie    i mean   a really   really   bad movie    not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood   gore and body parts shown on the screen   it blissfully jumps over that line   apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds   of which i saw many in the theatre      looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence   we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best   no strong lead characters   a blatant disregard for physics   and a very obvious naziesque theme    that being said   onto the review   the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation   who s logo bears a   strong   resemblance to a nazi german eagle     urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs   who are attempting to destroy earth    the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance   pledging allegiance to the federation   again   sound familiar        as the movie progresses   we are shown terror tactic training   as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm   and throws a knife through another s hand    eventually   the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy   to fight the bugs on their home planet    as our faster than light travelling   heroes   arrive on planet   they drop onto the planet   and burst our of their craft brandishing           what      you say     laser beam weapons    sonic weapons    phasers    photon cannons        nope   they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns   pump action rifles   and tactical nuclear weapons    i guess a lot of physics money r d went into travel and not weaponry    as the assault begins   our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon    two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them   and one even sees a streak fly by   but disregards it as nothing    this of course   leads to more massive carnage   blood shed   and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies    again   i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons    in the end   we see neil patrick   doogie howser   harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat   hat   and gloves    he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug   and then proclaims that the bugs are scared    this sets the troopers into a frenzy   as they are now one step closer to completing their goal   total genocide of a species   again   sound familiar          i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review   but given it s non existence   i may have anyway    i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart   but don t want to bore you too badly    in short   i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies   a drivers education accident scene film   and a complete blank screen   the plot   of course      i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone   anywhere   under any circumstance    copyright   c   1997 tim jandt

of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind    but there are those who will not   and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies     2001   a space odyssey       armageddon       apollo 13       the abyss       close encounters of the third kind       e   t    the extra terrestrial       alien     and   aliens      why    because there is not one original idea in   mission to mars      all of it is cribbed from other films   and in most cases   better films      if this is the sort of thing you don t mind   you might like the film    of course   there are other reasons not to like   mission to mars     the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven t used their brains in some time   and who don t intend to start during the film s running time       mission to mars   manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time    the plot   cribbed greatly from   2001     concerns a team sent to mars   the first manned trip ever made to the red planet    luke graham   don cheadle   leads the team   jointly formed of americans and russians    the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse   this being nothing like the pulse emitting monolith in   2001      that one was on the   moon       but when they try to study it   a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them   all except luke   who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station   which looks strangely like the rotating space station in   2001        a rescue mission is planned with husband   wife team woody blake   tim robbins   and terri fisher   connie nielsen     obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell   gary sinise     and extra crew member phil ohlmyer   jerry o connell   along for the ride    after some zero gravity dancing   they run into problems when one of their engines is blown   forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel    now stranded on mars with minimal supplies   the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home    after all   that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth       mission to mars   is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it   so let s start with one of the things that does work   director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film    that s it    everything else fails    the failure isn t de palma s fault   he s working from an atrocious script    only during the sequence aboard the ship   looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in   2001     where the rescue team s air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does   mission to mars   come to life    a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension   until you realize that the entire danger more danger attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film   it s just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes    take it out   and the plot isn t affected in any way    the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes   as does the rest of the film     why is the ship s computer   which sounds strangely like hal from   uh     2001     able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine    why did tim robbins  character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside    shouldn t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach    why are the characters such idiots    because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them    all the   conflict   is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene   which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot   during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know     jim   it s too bad you can t go on this mission because you were determined  psychologically inadequate  because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together      does anyone really talk like this    can t we find out these things in a less grating matter   like maybe in a flashback    the whole film is like that    the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what s going on   they must   tell   us exactly what we re looking at   every   time    sample dialogue from the film     shot of mars   astronaut a     look   there s mars   astronaut b     you sure that s mars      astronaut a     yeah   that s mars all right      astronaut c     hey   are you guys looking at mars      that exchange isn t actually in   mission to mars     but i wouldn t be surprised if it were    for all their cribbing from kubrick   spielberg   james cameron   and even ron howard   the makers of this film haven t learned to do something all those directors did very well   show and don t tell    de palma used to know how   but seems to have forgotten    this is mentally challenged filmmaking   they assume the audience won t get what s going on   so they explain everything five times over    fourth graders may appreciate this   but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted    the principal actors sleepwalk their way through   mission to mars     never managing to do away with an apparent   i m just here to get a paycheck   attitude    cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines    armin mueller stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo    robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard   decent guy   performance    and sinise hams it up with   wistful   facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife   played by kim delaney   who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy handed monologue about the meaning of life     and especially during the stolen from no less than three movies   a lollipop to whoever names them   conclusion   which combines endless   obvious explanation and sub par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then    and of course   these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in   2001   who facilitated the evolution of life on earth   those aliens were from an   unknown   world    it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy   mission to mars     but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow going    leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it   but all of the substance of   mission to mars   has been stolen from other films   and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters    supposedly we re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one   totally different from the one character decides not to return ending of   armageddon       but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning    me   i alternated between the two    there is only one good thing about the way   mission to mars   finally ends   the fact that the movie is over

1622	1	set in the late 80 s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis   who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie   less than zero     american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie   genre   that ellis helped to create    christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman   a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc   e and his colleagues    it seems that bateman is a serial killer and   unfortunately for his contemporaries   his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip    as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies   his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel    i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school    i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it    as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out   but i soon forgot about the novel and didn t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore    i picked it up and read it   but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers    the movie has a similar effect   but at least it s less cryptic than ellis  novel    for once   a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on    both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations   down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses   but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout    the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does    as a result   the film is immensely more entertaining    lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films   having picked up kevin smith s catholic rattling dogma   and here with american psycho there is no difference    screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it    some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc 17   mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women   and initial reports said the film was unwatchable    thankfully   it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park   bigger   longer   uncut    side note  1   co writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill fated acquaintance of bateman s who   after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute   proclaims that she s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it    the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner   the writer director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy   is a lesbian    it s a subtle in joke and it s one i found to be pretty humorous    despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up and comers   including reese witherspoon     most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos    the real draw here is christian bale and his over the top performance as patrick bateman    whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters    i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman   but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being    to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger    one sequence in particular   involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news  song   hip to be square   right before burying an axe in a co worker s head   features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film    side note  2   despite the fact that huey lewis    hip to be square   and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film   don t expect to see them on the soundtrack release    huey lewis expressly requested that his song   featured in a rather large set piece in the film   much akin to the use of   stuck in the middle with you   in reservoir dogs     not be included on any soundtrack release    i m assuming that collins requested the same    on a similar note   whitney houston s cover of   the greatest love of all   is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source    apparently   houston wasn t as open about the use of her song as the others were    a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film s release   that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film    don t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more    several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i m still undecided    there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops   old ladies   and cleaning staff with equal gusto    the scene seemed very dream like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying   as an example   bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car      i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there   but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence   though comic   throws the film off balance   which i suppose was the intention      other than the few flaws i have mentioned   american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film   although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman s reality      i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such    it may not change anyone s life   but it will certainly have an effect    i know i will certainly hear   hip to be square   in a different context the next time i hear it     r

361	0	like a good action film should     metro   has action that keeps you involved    some action films have action sequences that are so conventional   our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts       the ghost in the darkness     which opened a few months ago   is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving   it not only invited my thoughts to divert me   it nearly put me asleep    but   metro   is one of the best action films in a while    it is hip   sharp   nifty   and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy    eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while    and this invites me to mention last year s   the nutty professor     which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be       metro   happens to be a lot better than any film in the   beverly hills cop   series    that is because   metro   takes itself seriously   but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun    eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible   and controlled people    the   beverly hills cop   movies all featured eddie as a reckless   wild cop   always crossing the line by just an inch    in   metro   he plays a hostage negotiator   so negotiation is his job   not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble    his character in   metro   takes himself seriously    eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in   metro     and perhaps it is quite better off that way    murphy plays scott roper   and as i previously mentioned   he is a san francisco hostage negotiator    in the first tense situation in the film   we are introduced to roper s kind of work   as he tries to calm down a confused   unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up    murphy handles the scene seriously   without his usual happy go lucky   misfit humor    the film develops when its villain is established   and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda   a jewel thief   and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim       metro   takes different twists and slight turns   and there is one great   virtuoso chase scene   involving the a cable car    cars flip    cars crash    cars turn over    and it is done so good in this film   i was reminded of   speed     and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons    there are also some other good scenes in   metro   that a lot of films would rather choose not to have    scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning    of course   the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling    the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice   too    those are the scenes that make up   metro     which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality    the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in   metro   was michael rapaport   who plays roper s new partner   a lip reading   book skimming genius   and a master of observation    it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius    rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really   really dopey dimwit    i hardly recognized him in   metro     and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more    there are two main types of villains in movies like this   the ones that are part of the story   and the ones that are devices    the villain in   metro   is no more than a device   but he is a darn good villain nonetheless    he is played by michael wincott   whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp   as if he smokes a cigarette between every take    wincott makes his villain   korda   as mean as could be   the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks   like richard widmark in   kiss of death      and   in addition   wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms   in the film   actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have   who is no longer on my good list    i liked   metro     and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy    his past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place   possibly from murphy s growing as a person   now having a family       metro   is a no nonsense movie    it works as a buddy movie   which it does not overplay    it works as a dry comedy   which it does not overplay    it works as a suspense film   which it does not overplay    and it works as an action film   where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all out    but who cares    it still remains serious   and it does not overdo itself    oh   and there were plenty of explosions in   metro     as well    how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those    if there is one major objection i had to   metro     it was the length   an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes       metro   is a film that lasted a little too long   but it was still entertaining   and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end    paul haynes

1327	1	i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago   picking up the grand jury prize at the festival     holocaust comedy receives standing ovation    the headlines read    intrigued by this statement   i looked up information on the film and found that   sure enough   life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years    even though the movie was extremely well received by critics and public alike   i couldn t help but be disgusted at this notion   human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated    only now do i see the error of my ways    after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time   it became clear that it is not   as the headlines proclaimed   a   holocaust comedy     on the contrary   life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps    rather   it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son   who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation    roberto benigni   who also wrote and directed the movie   stars as guido orefice   a chaplin inspired clown and all round jolly guy who   as the film opens   is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher   nicoletta braschi   benigni real life spouse      through the course of the first hour or so   we see guido striving to get the attention of this   beautiful princess     as he calls her    employing the magic of laughter   the italian comedian wins her heart and together   they raise a young boy named giosue   child actor giorgio cantarini      life treats them well until hitler s minions rise to power   and the family is whisked away to a german camp   where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son s innocence no matter what the sacrifice    granted   it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp   but it does not pull a   hogan s heros   and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews    somehow   it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it s gravely serious subject    so   we ve established that life is beautiful is not a   holocaust comedy      but   there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me    the film   despite critic s declarations of it being a   triumph of the human spirit     is no such thing   not in my eyes   anyway    some have called the story an   affirmation of the beauty of life     but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy    the film s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently   but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting    essentially   life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film    however   i am not denying the movie s greatness    believe me   it s fantastic    i m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as    but perhaps i m reading more into the movie than is really there    maybe the film s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit    in fact   maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it    
1955	1	books could be   and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy   and rightfully so    this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s early 80s   inspiring literally dozens of clones   from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day   and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre    the special effects were groundbreaking   revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later    literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it    and now   george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy    much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr   lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now    some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection   while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday s star wars updated with today s special effects wizardry    either way   the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen   where it rightfully deserves to be seen    can there be anyone in the world who doesn t know what star wars is about    in a way   star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it    it s a story about a young man s coming of age   a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire   a tale of swashbuckling and derring do the likes of which haven t been seen on the silver screen in decades   strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn   and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world    it s high adventure   incredible special effects   and       well   it s just an  experience     something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation       and  it s about to do so again    this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film s devoted fans   who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now    interviews   trailers   leaks from within lucasfilm       all of these have been collected   collated   and placed on webpages for people to see   pages such as http     www   islandnet   com  corona films details sw4   html  or   my personal favorite   http     leopard   cs   latrobe   edu   au  koukoula         pictures of before and after have been placed side by side       even  months before the movies were released   fans were making comparisons    in some cases   the changes were nothing less than phenomenal   and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater    the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here   unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original    for instance   in my personal favorite example   the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep   moss covered carvings and etchings    and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling   booming city   with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing    all the starships and fighters are now computer animated   getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made  and they look  fantastic     four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added   including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn t do it justice    however   much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself    the negatives   badly damaged by the ravages of time   were brightened and returned to their original splendor    the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed   with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt   into glorious   booming   theater shaking full thx dolby digital stereo    and  that    more than the added scenes or new special effects   is where the real value of this new version lies    it s really true what they say in the commercials   star wars loses  so much  on the small screen    even letterboxing doesn t make up for the decrease in size and definition    in regard to the star wars special edition   and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released   i ll make this final recommendation   go and see it    go and see it more than once       it  may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it s gone this time    take along the youngsters who ve never had the big screen star wars experience  you ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time    there s magic in this movie  special edition or no   there can be no denying that it s still star wars   and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages   from four to four hundred    let s all return to that time long ago   and that galaxy far   far away        
1039	1	the event of events is upon us    people have waited twenty two years for the prequel to star wars and die hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it    i don t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused    it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history    anyone who tells you   it s just a movie   is either lying or clueless    it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic    the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz   which is far too weak a word   that star wars epsode i   the phantom menace so effortlessly generated    but that does not mean that the film itself is bad    in fact   it is terrific    i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash    it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place    the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging   the trade federation   angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small   peaceful planet of naboo    the republic sent two jedi knights   people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as   the force       qui gon jinn   liam neeson   and obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   to negotiate    unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur   the jedi and the queen of naboo   natalie portman   escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene    on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine   where they meet the movie s real focal point   young anakin skywalker   jake lloyd      he is an innocent slave boy   but   the force is strong with him   so qui  gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi    as any self respecting star wars fan should know   anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker     from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor s movie    around 70  of the characters   if not more   are computer generated in one form or another   and though the effects are seamless   the movie lacks soul    i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade   cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this    this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far   with plenty of broad comic relief to go around   much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar jar binks    he s essentially a computer animated sidekick who says things like   exqueeze me      and   mesa go now   okeday       and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying    the visual effects are astounding   although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them   and the movie is a thrilling triumph    if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement    the climactic lightsaber battle   oh   come on   as if you didn t already know     among other things   is outrageously entertaining and defines the term   popcorn movie      what made me surrender and give this movie       1 2 stars was the score by john williams    even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days   his work here is nothing short of brilliant    his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling    the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia    when you see   a long time ago   in a galaxy far   far away     when the familiar music plays   when the words   star wars   appear on screen   you ll feel a tingle even if you didn t see the movie when it first came out in  77    it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin   a boy whose innocence   we know   will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side    it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts   we know that it will do more harm than good   but they do not    we not only feel more involved in the story   but we feel like we re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years    the phantom menace   although lacking in human aspects of the story   is a very worthy installment in the star wars    it works as an action flick   visually eye popping and often paralyzingly exciting   it also works as an elicitor of memories   a piece of exquisite nostalgia       1999 eugene novikov  137

1503	1	as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it   the more pleased i was when i left    first   getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz     if you liked scream   you ll love wild things         campbell gives a stunning performance         this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days         oh yeah   the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me    now   onto more serious stuff   and with this film   i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way      wild things has single handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa    i m not saying that in a bad way   but when you see this film   you may be shocked by what you see    however   perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film s charming cast and tricky plot   that they let the film slide with an r rating    being mormon   i m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film    trouble is   i have already seen it    and i like it    wild things is a film noir of the 90s   filled with 40s sensibilities   and yet breaking the rules and modern day taboos of 90s culture    the style in which it is filmed is rich in color    the actors are all gorgeous people   seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film    sure   it s all too good to be true   but ain t it fun to watch    when movies like this come along   sort of a better version of basic instinct   there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it    there will be people who don t want to admit liking what they see   but i tell you   most anyone who sees this will like it    wild things begins at blue bay high school   the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into    it s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance   totally based on looks alone      of course   there are those select few who may look slightly ugly   but compared to the average person   they are gorgeous    immediately   the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time    we can turn off our brains   right    wrong    while you may be expecting one thing to happen   it certainly doesn t turn out that way    the film begins in a classroom   with nearly all the main characters present    there s sam lombardo   matt dillon     a counselor for the students    he s heading the class discussion    there s also kelly van ryan   denise richards     a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam    teaching the class   however   are two policemen   ray duquette   kevin bacon   and gloria perez   daphne rubin vega     who want to talk about  sex           cheers   crimes   boos           what is a sex crime      ray asks       not gettin  any      one student responds    this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch    however   upon hearing this   one student   suzie toller   neve campbell     stands up and leaves the room   commenting that they can both kiss part of her body    and so   wild things sets into motion    quickly   kelly begins hitting on sam   but sam doesn t want anything to do with her advances    kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him    she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep    surprisingly   that s really all i can tell you about the plot    any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists    and what s more   these plot twists are actually unpredictable    going along the way of scream   wild things maintains that film s surprises   and then adds even more to them    there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen    and even though you think you may get tired of them   the surprises are so genuine that it s rather pleasing    going back over them in my mind   nearly all of them work   though some stretch the boundaries of belief    thankfully   the convoluted plot doesn t give us much time to think about each one   pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off    as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy  well   it is    this is pretty much just one trashy film    however   it is the kind of trashy that isn t hard to watch    it s good trash   in a sense    one   the screenplay knows that it s not to be taken seriously   and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story    this varies everywhere from kelly s mother   theresa russell     who is more of a caricature of rich people   all the way to an ambulance chasing lawyer   bill murray     who wears a neck brace to cover an insurance scam he is running    bill murray also provides the best character in the film   and most of the genuine laughs    and two   the sex is more than gratuitous   although not unwelcomed    wild things is supposed to have sex in it   what film with that title wouldn t       and this movie breaks the boundaries    instead of having heterosexual sex scenes   it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell   don t worry        it s not as graphic as you might think      the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic   but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon s full frontal nude scene    it s very brief   so if you blink   you may miss   ahem   it    and   for as long as i can remember   i don t think i have seen an r rated film show an erect one before   it s not completely   but judging from the audiences  reaction   it was more than they expected too      also   during one scene late in the film   there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon s characters   but nothing came of it   makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating   or if the actors refused to do it      what first made me want to see wild things was its cast    neve campbell   of course   has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released    here   however   she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead    the closest role to this was her performance in the craft   though even in that she was a nice girl      campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent    you can tell she will be around for a long time    denise richards will also be around for a long time   although she may be limited to the roles without much range    here   she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff   yet effective   performance in starship troopers    hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability    and then there is daphne rubin vega   a newcomer to the movies    she gives a very good performance   although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half    towards the end she does get a bigger part    on the male side   matt dillon is probably the best   giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist    kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character   but he makes the most of it    you must have admiration   though   for what he did on screen    and judging from many of the women s reactions in the theater to that shot   they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon   yeah   right      and then there is bill murray    his performance is the comic relief   and he nearly steals the film    as a whole   the entire cast works wondrously together   and they seem at home   even when doing the menage a troi    director john mcnaughton   who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry   portrait of a serial killer   has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works    his direction is smooth and stylish    the visuals are striking   filled with rich colors   and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air    however   he seems more at home when the actors aren t talking    his fly by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant   and his photography of denise richards  climbing out of the pool is a highlight    the cinematography is gorgeous in its details   its not often that you see a film like this   and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures    then   there is the music    this was probably the most obvious thing to me   as it set the perfect mood for the film    it s hard to describe in words   so just see the film and listen to it    it s wonderfully composed and presented    and be sure to stick around during the closing credits    mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use   while most comedies use it for outtakes      he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events    some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot   but it s an entertaining way to finish the film    plus   there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun    wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality   nudity   language and violence    again   the nudity is rather unnecessary   but let s face it  people want to see it    so why not give it to them    neve campbell   admirably   has a no nudity clause in her contract   and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off   way to go   neve        the sex scenes are graphic   especially the first one we see   between the mother and one of her deck hands    one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating    the language is quite harsh too   ranging from sexual innuendo to your average   everyday profanity    and i can t stress it enough   don t allow kids under 18 to see this film    the target age for the movie is the 18 24 range   and that s who should see it    it s definitely not for those under 18    did i mention that this film is rated r   however   for those that do get a chance to watch it   you will probably more likely be pleased   and may even take friends to see it the next time    
1250	1	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    among my fanatical ticker tape worshipping friends   there s one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky s darkly original pi   the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which   through analysis   will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour       an example of the mentality involved   if the stock price goes up like this   and then down like that   and then sharply up this way   it then will go   this   way      while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market   knowledge check   prices up    good   prices down    bad   most of the time   at least   and hence really couldn t comment with any authority   it s always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system   and besides   if it were that simple   no doubt somebody would ve already figured it all out      the difference in this case is that while my colleague   an otherwise assuredly realistic individual   truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster   pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character s psychosis    it s also vastly more convincing with its argument       mathematics is the language of the universe     insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen   sean gullette   in a cool   mantra like voice over which repeats throughout the picture    since nature can be expressed in numbers   and there are patterns everywhere in nature   he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything    the ups and downs of the stock market   how many

perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism   in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one s individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers   max

in virtually every scene     pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics   because of our ambivalence with max   we re not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we re following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination    it s more disturbing journey than quest    still   we do care about max s fate    teetering on the edge of dementia   he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain   both fronted by deliciously perky   resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions    as we know   in films where paranoia is a dominant element   see the truman show s laura linney character     or for that matter   in real life   it s always

picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max s claustrophobic perspective    in this regard   it wildly succeeds due to mr   aronofsky s striking direction    it s a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist s warped perspective of his surrounding   and high contrast black and white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings       in some scenes   the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr   gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter day max schreck   from nosferatu      using savage   jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation   the picture is often dizzying to behold   and max s effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so called snorri cam   which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts    pi s raw   aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch s early work   in particular   eraserhead      the film s sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score

983	0	director luis mandoki s last film was the superb   serious 1994 drama   when a man loves a woman     but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture     message in a bottle     which is the worst type of romance   a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up    everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before   and much better   so there s an absence of suspense   and the film ultimately moves at such a very   very deliberate pace   as if it is trying to make great     meaningful   statements and plot developments   that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through       message in a bottle   begins with theresa osborne   robin wright penn     a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune   whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day    inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine   and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and   to her objection   finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper    soon   a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message   and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake   theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks   a boating town in north carolina   to find out the specifics of the message    of course   garrett turns out to be a handsome   rugged man around theresa s age and played by kevin costner    she is immediately charmed by him   but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there   and finds that catherine was garrett s late wife who died a few years earlier    do you think you know where this is headed    most likely you do   and i wouldn t call it giving away anything to say that by the picture s end   the movie has fallen into deep   artificial melodrama that i didn t buy for a second    if there are any positive things to say about   message in a bottle     it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman   as garrett s stubborn   but loving father   are far above par to be in such a wasteful     shaggy dog   love story   and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast   and paints chicago as an equally alluring city    meanwhile   costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less than stellar films that he has made recently    it seems that with such bad luck   he wouldn t want to make another movie set near water   but here he is again with one of the main   and most ridiculous   centerpieces set on a storm swept sea    the other actors are all   sadly   wasted   including illeana douglas   an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the   friend   roles   here playing penn s confidante and co worker at the tribune    the first half of   message in a bottle   plays like a hum drum   trite television movie for the lifetime channel   as theresa spends a great deal of time   getting to know   garrett   with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining    usually   i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships   but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt   written     and not as if people were really   talking      when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other   and are not particularly interesting themselves   you know immediately that you are in trouble    i swear that while watching   message in a bottle     i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater   heck   in actuality i m not even familiar to the novel this is based on   by nicholas sparks      always one step ahead of the characters   the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried and true hollywood melodrama   the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing    nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa s secret   and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after    this same exact problem occurred in last year s very   very similar   watch this   and you will realize just how similar i mean   meg ryan nicolas cage romantic drama     city of angels      although theresa is deeply touched by the   heartfelt   letter that she finds in the bottle   perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own   preferably before filming began    it should have read     memo to screenwriters   use you brain      
45	0	   party camp     is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i ve seen in awhile    a late rip off of the   meatballs   series   the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk    that s really about all that can be said about the   plot   because nothing much happens   except that the main character   wise cracking jerry   andrew ross     has the hots for a cute blonde   kerry brennan     and there is a big contest in the climax    how fun    since     party camp     has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved   the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative    it s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality   but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this   the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex    even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick    at least   then   it wouldn t have been such a chore to sit through    never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat    the comedy was easy to spot   but it wasn t the least bit funny    it was groan inducing    constantly throghout   i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything    so what saves     party camp     from the dreaded zero star rating    well   that s simple   jewel shepard   as a flighty bimbo   was admittedly fun to watch    although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash   at least if the film had centered on shepard   she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid   low budget teen comedy    
1204	1	steven spielberg s   amistad     which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship   then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who   owned   them   is concerned with several different aspects of this story    first   the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery    second   it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case   including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams   anthony hopkins      last   and most importantly   it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade       amistad   succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements    i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another   anti slavery   movie    having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery   i doubted that there was much i didn t already know about it    fortunately   i turned out to be wrong    for one thing   spielberg s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders  operations in africa   so   amistad   was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning    and some of the images here are   in fact   much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery    one scene in the middle   in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their   excess   slaves by throwing them overboard to drown   has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year    spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would   and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc 17 rating    the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians   such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain   whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time    exposing politicians as narrow minded   opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff   of course   but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation    the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time   such that john quincy adams   and probably other politicians like him     who clearly disapproved of the practice   was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court    the biggest success of   amistad   is probably the characterization of cinque   djimon hounsou     who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin   matthew mcconaughey     the lawyer who represents them in court    through cinque   we are given a window into the native culture   as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member   or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ    cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that   again   contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles       what kind of country is this   where laws  almost  work     he asks baldwin in bewilderment   when he learns that the case must be re tried before the supreme court    spielberg s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times   such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque s angry outburst in the court room    still   there isn t enough of this for it to be a serious problem    the main flaw in this film   which prevents it from earning four stars   is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can t quite handle all of these issues at the same time   so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie    this summer s contact   for example   dealt with several issues at once   but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and   most importantly   all of them were resolved at once       amistad   tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams   but it somehow feels a little forced   and in any case the speech itself   which lasts almost fifteen minutes   wears out its welcome about halfway through    perhaps the best way to describe it is this     amistad   is three four star films edited into one    almost every individual scene works   but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence   and thus is less than the sum of its parts    however   i can t honestly say how it could have been done differently   and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film   and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery

uncle   and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la   mystery science theatre 3000     and this was a couple years before i had heard of   mystery science theatre 3000      in this one   seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased up typical shallow villain   this time played by an oscar winner to give the movie some more clout   michael caine    it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land    around the 20 30 minute point   seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs   what with his new   fire down below     another   message film       and caine has him bumped off       or  does he    seagal is rescued by some inuits   and falls in love with one of them   played by joan chen   who can act   hypothetically   but   for some reason   not here    one of caine s cliched henchmen   played here with a lot of overacting by john c   mcginley   shoots the cheif of the inuit clan   and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory       literally    of course    at one point   seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn t have any options but blow stuff up    he even goes as far as to say     i don t want to kill someone     and in the same breath   he asks some guy where the arsenal is    i have no problem with violence    i m a huge john woo fan   but he paints his films with suspense   skill   style   depth   characterization   and just plain cool violence    in the films of seagal   the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly   and him either wounding or killing them    at some points   they use the cliche of the talking villain   where the villain has the advantage   can shoot seagal   but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan   or saying a corny line   to which seagal says something hokey back   and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them   and does    this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn t take itself seriously at all   like in the case of this summer s   con air      but seagal is serious about his skill   and of course   his message    i wouldn t mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence    but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle   not pounded into the viewer s mind    the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish   thus we can t take him and his motives seriously   and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment   he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig   and kills some workers who were just doing his job    then at the end   he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech   just in case you didn t get the message from the trailers    what seagal doesn t realize is that no one takes his films seriously   although maybe a couple do   and any message he has is no only redundant   but doesn t comfortably fit in his film   which is filled to the brim with hokey violence   crap suspense   stupid melodrama   and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish    as far as seagal and his acting   he s rather boring    he squints   he kills    period    nothing else    oh   yeah   there s corny one liners     i m gonna reach out and touch someone          of course   he s the star   and we re supposed to root for him and all   so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks    michael caine   who s a great actor   is just supposed to yell and look cold    he does it well   i guess   but this is no   alfie      of coure   no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him    his big henchman   john c   mcginley is kinda boring as well   but is not horrible    and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid   r   lee ermey   from   full metal jacket     as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is   just for the movie trailers and for seagal s ego    and also   look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey s assasins    anyway   to conclude this all   to judge one of seagal s movies is to judge all of them   except for   under siege   and   executive decision     though the latter is not really a   seagal movie        they all have this same formula   they all have the same action   same villain   same plot   but this one has that message   which makes it more excrucitating to watch    i mean   if you do rent it   and i don t reccomend you do   make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes    but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad   that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one    my   extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock    
909	0	all right   all right   we get the point   despite all similarities to the best selling story   speechless is   not   based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin    in fact   the script was in development well before 1992    still   the comparisons are inevitable   until one realizes a critical difference    no   it s not that the speechless twosome are speech writers   not campaign managers   it s that carville and matalin s story is actually interesting    speechless is a limp   poorly structured would be romantic comedy    speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign   where kevin vallick   michael keaton   and julia mann   geena davis   meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep    what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign   kevin is a sit com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate s speeches   while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate    at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship   but eventually they let down their guard and become closer    but there are plent of obstacles in the way   including julia s stud reporter fiance   christopher reeve   and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all s fair in love and politics    the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they re crazy about each other    screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other s arms in the first fifteen minutes   then developing the antagonism    it s a noble attempt to shake things up   but unfortunately it just doesn t work    part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do   but in speechless they already know they re attracted to each other   and we re left with waiting for the campaign to end so they ll admit that they love each other already    there is such a herky jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king s sharp dialogue can t prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour    inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton   and with those performances most of their scenes together    the problems begin with their initial courtship   which does virtually nothing to establish julia s character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise ass    davis is radiantly beautiful   and keaton is generally entertaining   but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit    in a couple of scenes   like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain   they actually achieve some measure of connection    for the most part   however   they re just actors spouting lines    you keep waiting for a little spark   and it never happens    perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless s politics    the setting seems perfect for a high  energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix   but that s never the tone that underwood is going for    he wants a warm   fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman s flute and wind musical score   and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background    it might as well have been a story about rival grocers   and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be    i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king s previous screenplay   the dana carvey flop clean slate   so i had some hopes for speechless    but while there is wit in the words   this is a script which was probably much better on paper    on screen   it s still paper thin

1427	1	as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens   i have some idea of how ellie aroway   jodie foster   feels    but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers   i can t say that i do exactly    her reason is that she needs solid proof   there is no proof that god existed   so therefor she does not believe    ellie also believes in aliens   and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist    how can she say she doesn t believe in god because of the lack of proof   and then say she believes in aliens   which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite    that s the catch 22    when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them   okay   well   they didn t really   fax   them          ellie wants to be the one to go   but because of her atheism she is denied the position    how dumb is that    she discovers the transmitions   then she isn t allowed to go    well   because of a bomb and a psychopath   jake busey     she   does   end up going   but not in the way that we would ve thought    contact is based on a novel by carl sagan   who died during the filmmaking    it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind   and will end up being the best film of the year    its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some   but will stimulate more    i m glad at least one movie of the  90s can portray aliens in a psitive light   rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body    
1539	1	before even seeing a single frame of the film   it would be easy to snicker at deep impact   in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet    it is the latest entry in this decade s dubious revival of the  70s disaster film   and the first of two   the sky is falling   flicks to hit screens this year   the other being this coming july s armageddon   in which a meteor is the threat      its tagline     oceans rise    cities fall    hope survives   is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight     they came in alone       the only way out        is together       but it s every bit as treacly    the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at    the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions   such as the usual opening   roll call     in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced    the most prominent of the   personal   stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner   tea leoni     who is distraught that her father   maximilian schell   left her mother   vanessa redgrave   for a younger woman   rya kihlstedt      what is just as snicker worthy is how this co venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high profile corporate collaboration   microsoft and nbc s cable news network msnbc   which employs jenny   who is the film s ostensible main character    in the vision of america presented here   msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home   when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country    the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante s peak   but there s one thing about deep impact i underestimated   the skills of director mimi leder    she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc s smash er   which is essentially a weekly disaster movie   each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises    the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold     1   to make the audience care for these guest characters   regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are   and   2   powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy handed or overly melodramatic    having passed the   er challenge   in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker   leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen    as the countdown to impact progresses   the ominous feeling of doom is palpable   leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension    there s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone   but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects    situations that initially feel contrived   such as jenny s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner   leelee sobieski   and comet discoverer leo biederman   elijah wood     achieve some poignance   and even the more vaguely drawn characters   including u   s   president tom beck   morgan freeman     astronaut spurgeon   fish   tanner   robert duvall     and his rather faceless crew   ron eldard   jon favreau   mary mccormack   blair underwood   and alexander baluyev   aboard the comet bombing spacecraft messiah   have their share of touching moments    the latter fact owes a debt to the actors   who all do a solid job and are well cast   with the possible exception of leoni   she delivers a decent performance   but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster    although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work   the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular   place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister   it is the first of the  90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true  a film that makes a genuine impact   even if it isn t as deep as hoped    
871	0	   easely one of the worst films of the year        with the millenium just around the corner   hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century    this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil    the result is somewhat predictable    i didn t have high hopes about arnold s   much anticipated   return to the big screen    schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased   action lovers won t be bored   and the catholic league will be angry    everyone else will see  end of days  for what it is   a deliciously bad motion picture    think of it as hollywood s own y2k bug    did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you ll get 999   as in 1999    yes   you better believe it     satan is here on earth   working on his latest project    the end of days    this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and   although not al pacino   he is fun to behold    he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker   wreaking   as they say   havoc    the way it works is he smirks and something explodes    before the stroke of the new millennium he s got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations    only schwarzenegger s cop attached to an anti terrorist unit can stop him    films like this has one serious weakness    logic    no matter how you twist the   plot     you ll find it incredibly stupid   even for a schwartzenegger movie        the incredible fact is that such directors never learn    after thousands of headless productions   this theme has become one big clich      here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution    he is walking around n   y     blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius    all he wants is the girl   that is somehow special    but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks   he has hidden her in a church   where satan dare not enter    so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information     you can have your wife and daughter back     i  can give you happiness that you can only dream of     just  give me the address        indeed with a script like that   you could make a wonderful parody   but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously   attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller    and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger s comeback   will not be very satisfied    we ve not seen him in a while    that s because he didn t have a worthy opponent    he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars    he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop    so   after all those fights   what s left for arnold schwarzenegger    how about satan    in my opinion   he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron s   terminator      and that is schwartzenegger s strength    muscles and no emotions    here he tries to achieve an artistic level   moving towards the oscar    this is called   an adult turn   if successful and   a flop   if unsuccessful    make a wild guess    his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems    this requires at least some acting skills    regrettably   the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles    the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters    the movie is otherwise technically impressive   with a solid cinematography and fine lighting    but the movie doesn t serve neither as a serious thriller   because of its stupidity   nor as comic entertainment   because of its serious tone      the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry    the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular    so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody    unless you are a die hard schwartzenegger fan   stay away    as for schwarzenegger   he ll be back

1741	1	you know you re in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question s most normal character    such is the case with   the big lebowski     joel and ethan coen s first venture since their   fargo   nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods    there s no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment   because   lebowski   is an effort that makes words like   strange   and   unusual   seem like an understatement    thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all encompassing sense of humor   the film is a smashing success    the central oddball here is the dude   jeff bridges     an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot   drinking beer and going bowling   are you college students already rooting for him   or what        one night   a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet   a threatening act that s supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire   david huddleston   who shares his birth name    jeff lebowski    with the dude    once the dude realizes this coincidence   he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug   and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter   john goodman     a hotheaded vietnam vet   and donny   buscemi     a mild mannered surfer   before too long    soon   though   lebowski s trampy trophy wife bunny   tara reid   is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom   and he turns to the dude for help    it seems bunny s troubles are related to a line of work she s kept secret from her husband    she s actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn    the dude   now on lebowski s payroll   accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop   walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself    chaos obviously ensues   and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops   crooks and lebowski s ultra eccentric artist daughter maude   julianne moore         the big lebowski   deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that   fargo   did   while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film     lebowski   is at least as breathtakingly imaginative    the movie boasts a mile high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over   but thankfully never does    the coens   joel directed   ethan produced and both wrote   keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale   and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick    whether we re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley esque dream sequence     the big lebowski   is immensely lively    there are those who will dislike this film   but not because it s boring    the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they re given    bridges exudes a likeable   surprisingly sweet presence   his dude sure isn t the cleanest guy around   but you d still follow him to another movie    goodman merits 1998 s first oscar consideration   as walter s manic temper is one of   the big lebowski    s many highlights   the same goes for moore   whose throaty   delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot    john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction    sam elliott s rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start    and some will recognize peter stormare      fargo    s silent heavy    as carl hungus   a porn star who s really a samurai sword wielding german nihilist and has been pop star    only in its final third does the movie falter   with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call    these flaws are forgivable   though    the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it s hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face    without a doubt     the big lebowski   is the best film so far this year    sure   we re only three months in and the competition     deep rising       desperate measures       the wedding singer     etc     has been pretty bland   but it s still the gospel truth    maybe during next awards season     lebowski   won t be a far cry from   fargo      
1484	1	sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to    it s not the time or the distance   it s the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy    yet somehow   the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story    the wings of the dove fits the pattern    kate   helena bonham carter   and merton   linus roache   are in love    merton   a newspaper writer   would like to marry kate    but kate s   job     if you will   is to be a member of the british upper class    her father lost all of her family s money   but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man    naturally   a newspaper writer s wages don t count as   rich      kate leads him on   but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder   ultimately because he s not marriageable    kate s american friend millie   alison elliot   stops in for a visit on her way to venice    at a party   millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees    kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie   he might forget about her    it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup    merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it    he is still in love with kate   and will accept no substitute    the three of them   along with a fourth friend   elizabeth mcgovern   end up on holiday in venice together   where their interactions are quite complicated    let s sum up   millie has fallen for merton    merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate    kate loves him but can t marry him   so on the one hand she s trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy   but on the other hand she s jealous of them as a couple    a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick   dying   in fact    at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies    millie will leave her money to merton   who will then be rich enough to marry kate    she lets merton know of her schemes and   since it will help him win kate   he reluctantly agrees    kate leaves venice so that the two m s can be alone together    merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her    he s not sure he can separate the two    kate finds that she s not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else    the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved    without revealing the details   suffice it to say that the situation ends badly    the title refers to the object of merton s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament    one is left with feelings of regret and despair    what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed   anger   and jealousy    an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over   and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir    a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after    their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other   and after a few things go wrong   the whole idea seems like an awful life ruining mistake    i wouldn t call the wings of the dove a film noir   but the comparison is interesting    as i have acknowledged before   i am not a wonderful judge of acting   but i liked the performances from roache and elliot    roache successfully conveyed his character s ambivalence toward millie   near the end   he hugs her   at first staring into space   as if he s thinking about his plan with kate   then giving that up to fully embrace millie    millie s part didn t require as much range   but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible    i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion    their settings are far removed from my personal experience   geographically   historically   and socially    still   the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over    
280	0	it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller    some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others   myself included   would pick seven days in may    both those films were tense exercises in chills    the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man   john frankenheimer    but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively    for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films   but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed    each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot    they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay    the thrills all came from the plot    ronin is like a film made by another man    somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot   but we see only tiny pieces of it    we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j   d   zeik s screenplay is a bit obscure    the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai    when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death   he becomes a ronin   much like a gunfighter in the american west    if you miss the opening   do not worry    this film will explain again what a ronin is    sam   played by robert de niro   is the modern equivalent of a ronin    he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer    he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france    sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre   natascha mcelhone of the truman show     an irish woman   to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case    dierdre is very tight lipped about what is in the case    sam joins a team of four others   vincent   jean reno of the professional leon and mission impossible     spence   sean bean   tv s richard sharpe   and also patriot games and goldeneye     and gregor   stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting      also along is larry   skipp suddeth      the group seems to know their business   particularly sam   but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise    their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team    the story is not very easy to follow    it is never clear who is double crossing whom and who is working for whom    somehow russians   who may or may not be the russian mafia   and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case    some very good actors are involved in this film    one wonders what they saw in the script    the characters are mostly one dimensional professional killers    they know their work   and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film   but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed    by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody    maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts   since these are not very demanding characters to create    in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale   the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal      as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s   i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy    unfortunately there are no deep characters   and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it    i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to  4 scale    non spoiler   incidentally   the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times   usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin    also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet    this is the first blow of the 47 ronin

561	0	this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset   the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st    elsewhere for several years   and i had understood that the director screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also    i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations   nor were they satisfactory    if i had to list a reason why          but that would be getting ahead of myself   besides   it s not immediately clear   as there are so many problems with the film    adam arkin plays a grade school teacher who is sardonic   cynical   and somewhat abrasive   but a good teacher    he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court    one day   he meets a drifter   david morse   who plays jack morrison on st    elsewhere   in the park   and inveigles him in a game of one on one basketball    morse turns out to be good   and a friendship slowly develops between the two   as their respective professions progress on the screen  arkin s teaching   and morse s selling of paper flowers to passing motorists    so far   my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue   and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack    good music to be sure   but it doesn t replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story  it makes the film somewhat minimalistic   a technique i rarely admire    suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse s introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin s   a woman arkin has long admired from afar   but it too reticent to approach    it appears that she begins to admire morse   who enjoys here attentions   but isn t sure what to do about it  she doesn t realize that he is a drifter   and knows nothing about his past     and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else    until then   i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film    the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full fledged failure    the woman   at least to me   appeared to be fairly shallow   i didn t realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin   where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse    somehow   this is made to appear as if it is arkin s fault   and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he s gotten such a find of girlfriend    frankly   dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make   punching her in the mouth not the least    after this   the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural    if i had to summarize a major gripe   it s that this is a story spread too thin   that creates semi likable characters at the outset   and then suddenly jerks them into being 16 year olds at the last moment    it might be true to life with some people   but that doesn t mean   i   have to like it    i don t        avoid    
536	0	although i had not been a viewer of the   rugrats   television series   i went into their first animated feature film     the rugrats movie     with a positive attitude    the trailer looked cute enough   after all    after seeing it   i think the words in my recent   antz   review   in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995 s   the pebble and the penguin     were a bit premature       the rugrats movie     is bottom of the barrel children s fare at its worst   and starts to make     antz   look good in comparison    as in the show     the rugrats movie     is about a group of very little friends   ranging from babies to a three year old    the head of the group   tommy pickles   e   g    daily     becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill   get it    dill pickles         hardee har har     and is informed by his three year old cousin   anjelica   cheryl chase     that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children    when the other children   chuckie   and twins lil and phil   suggest taking dill back to the hospital   tommy goes along with it   but on their way there   they crash in the forest   and become lost   running into wolves and circus monkeys   among other things       the rugrats movie     judging from the idea of being lost in the woods   could have been a potentially fun family film   and there were many different things that could have been done with the story    so what did the writers choose to do    why   they set up a protracted   cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall   of course    for the youngest of children   ages 3 7       the rugrats movie     may very well entertain them   judging from the audience i saw this with    of course   if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents   they were all desperately struggling to stay awake   and that included me    for an adult     the rugrats movie     is a piece of garbage    the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm    there isn t one laugh to be had in the film   nor is there any excitement    if anything is even marginally good in the picture   it is the bright animation style   so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn t to service a more quality film       the rugrats movie   is doa from the start    i am all for a worthwhile family movie   but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful    as said before   young children may like it   but even they deserve better than this    for adults   it is a nearly unbearable   excruciating chore to sit through    as for me     the rugrats movie     is not the worst of the year   nor is it the most deeply hated   but it is the most boring    parents   do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of     the wizard of oz      that is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder   two things of which     the rugrats movie     is completely missing    
281	0	the main problem with martin lawrence s pet project   a thin line between love and hate   like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man   is that his character is an irresponsible jerk   and if that is the case   it doesn t seem to do anything except justify the woman s actions    that is especially the case in lawrence s darnell wright    he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long    now don t think i condone this just because i m male    my philosophy is   if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful   kind girl   you should treat her like a princess and respect her    darnell doesn t think like this    he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them    and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target   beautiful   wealthy brandi web   played nicely by whitfield   who runs a successful real estate business   is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia   king     i found myself thinking     i m supposed to feel sorry for this guy      after all   it is largely darnell s fault    if he is lining up all these women   you d think he d have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day   as his mother says it does    but he doesn t   so you get the sense that he s not only irresponsible   but also pretty dumb    you especially get this sense that he s dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her       i d put my pants on in two seconds after that      now   brandi is a psycho bitch   but it s hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage    one final flaw   though   is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with    brandi is a classy   intelligent woman with an mba from harvard   who initally resists darnell s   immature play   as she calls it   as any woman like her would in real life    but all of a sudden she says yes    but when you listen to darnell s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions   you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period   much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him    lawrence can be good when he wants to   but in order to prove it   he needs to let other people write and direct his movies    look at this movie    four writers   as a result it s too long   two hours   when it could ve easily worked at ninety minutes     and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came   which makes me think the writers didn t get along     all of which isn t necessary    there are some bright spots   though    whitfield   regina king   della reese   and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts   and they help it out a lot    and there are some funny parts   like   for example   the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property     but they re just not enough to sustain the film

502	0	you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year    they re obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes   having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box office holiday season      combine that with howie long s first starring action role   and you ve got a doozy of a movie that   while not as bad as it could have been   isn t a very good film    howie stars as an ace smokejumper   a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground      in the slightly contrived opening scenes   we witness his heroism in action   as he   and his mentor   played by scott glenn   attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire    william forsythe plays the bad guy   a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak    he   and five convict cohorts   manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby    his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards   but   since there must be a movie   luck is with him    soon the now escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters    why canadian    who knows   eh    along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher   suzy amis   to be their hostage    enter howie long    he s called in to help fight the blaze   and when he spots the group of   ground pounders     apparently lost   he parachutes in to help    when he discovers their true identity   he is the only thing standing between them and escape   and the only hope of help for the hostage    long s acting talents are above those of   say   steven seagal   but not by much    although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden   he s a likeable hero   and there are some hints here and there that he may get better    the script doesn t help him out any   however    all too often   it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny    the dialogue is strictly b movie material   and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable    long s co stars are a mixed bag    at least they re all comfortable in their respective roles    forsythe has the scenery chewing villain down cold   down cold   and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch   even when he doesn t seem to be stretching his talents   as is definitely the case here      suzy amis plays peril pretty well   but isn t given much more to do    some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting   but many are rather bland    you d think that the director   dean semler   a former cinematographer   would at least produce a film with interesting visuals    that s not the case    there s a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences       we ve  seen this stuff before    it s not the most auspicious start to 1998   but it could have been worse   just think back to 1996 s debut   bio dome      however   after a month of oscar caliber pictures   a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were    in fact   there s a good chance that some of them are still playing near you        
352	0	   what is this   a homicide or a bad b movie      that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie    let me clear things up for you cupcake   this isn t a bad b movie   it s a really bad b movie    so bad   it s almost good    almost   but not quite    the movie starts off in the 1950 s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth    it is a bunch of slug like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies    the slugs  first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody    that is   until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986    he   and the slugs inside him   promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co eds into slug zombies    a slightly crazed cop   tom atkins   and the requisite girl with the face of an angel   jill whitlow   join these two geeky university students   jason lively and steve marshall   to do battle with the slugs    it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs    the acting is bad with a capital b   the story is worse    and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie    the only saving grace was the requisite tit shot courtesy of jill whitlow    it had absolutely nothing to do with the story    but i liked it    actually   it was the high point of the movie for me    of course   that isn t really saying much    the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion    which gives it a leg up on some other horror films    unlike most movies of this genre   there actually is a story    not a great one   but it is there    this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980 s that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th   halloween and nightmare on elm street movies    you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better    but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b movie horror marathon    just don t be too upset if you can t find it    you really won t be missing that much    
808	0	in 1989   tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather    was it   deep      nope    however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up    it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was   without the comic book uplift   of the indiana jones and superman pictures    which was true    if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man s escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place    if those films were tom sawyer   then batman was huckleberry finn    some critics   glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone   realized that it was something special   mr   lovell gave it       1 2 and wrote that   this is batman as batman should be        mr   travers called it one of the ten best films of the year    the praise was deserved   from start to finish the film was enthralling   exciting   and superb in every respect    there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton    the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes    the villains   the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman   take over   and our epectations are always left unfulfilled   when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman s nose he simply gets mad   and when we want catwoman to slither over batman s body she gets pushed off a building    i admire mr   burton for trying to do more then entertain   but the result is a mess    nothing works out as planned   it fails both to entertain and to enlighten    hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast    alas   these are only hints    there are   don t misunderstand me   several moments of cinematic genuis contained   catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said   christopher lloyd is trapped   by the penguin   within a giant cage   a small basket is dropped into a large river   but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis    a weak followup   both career and sequel wise   batman returns is sometimes dazzling   but to often dissapointing    
1821	1	one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable    you know   the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information   and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is    sure   it s been used over and over   but for some reason   it is always fun to watch    this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on   overused   but always fun    one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is   but how it goes around giving its story    this rule applies highly to kiss the girls    there is something psychologically stimulating in a well crafted serial killer movie   and kiss the girls is certainly well made    however   the whole film screams of unoriginality   and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through    well   not only are the actors capable of pulling it through   but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up    unfortunately   one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers   one that seven   a film a lot like this one   knew not to make   was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits    that may give the actor credit for the role   but throughout the film   hidden in my mind   i was waiting for him to appear on screen   which spoiled the mystery    however   credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film    plotwise   kiss the girls shows almost no originality    we are introduced to detective alex cross   morgan freeman     a forensic psychologist   and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero    he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself    obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun   but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene    at his house   cross is told that his neice   naomi   gina ravera     has been missing for four days    this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer   but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two   and as a result   we can t sympathize with detective cross    however   what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees        before she is abducted    dr   kate mctiernan   ashley judd   the actress of the judd family   is a smart   athletic woman   and because of these traits   becomes a target for casanova  what the serial killer likes to call himself    because of these character developing scenes   we care for mctiernan   making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful    after being abducted   mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods    remembering that the killer gave her certain rules   she decides to break one of them by calling out    when casanova comes to punish her   she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall    after she is found   she begins to help cross find his neice    from this moment on   kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film   as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive    many people will compare this film to 1995 s seven   another killer film starring morgan freeman   but i presume that the similarities are intentional    the screenplay   by david klass   is adapted from the novel written by james patterson   and yet i don t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form    what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness    the cinematography   by aaron schneider   is reminiscient of seven   and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us    sometimes a simple shot is the best one    however   many of the shots are stunning   and unlike seven   most of them take place during the day   in sunlight    the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done   in more than one way    the camera work is terrific   but the editing makes this scene work so well    the chaotic and mtv type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness   exactly what judd s character is experiencing    however   the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors    morgan freeman is one of today s most powerful and believable actors    detective cross is a very good character for him   although it is just a similar one to the character in seven    because of freeman s powerful presence   he carries half the film by himself    the other half is carried by ashley judd   one of today s most promising dramatic actresses    in fact   her performance is better than freeman s   if that is even possible    her character is more original than freeman s   and she handles it wonderfully    we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream    the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped   but the cast members do as much as they can with it    cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina   and unfortunately has scraps for a character    tony goldwyn fairs slightly better   but we don t really get to know his character either    gina ravera gives a good performance   but again she isn t in many of the scenes    so as a result of all these small supporting parts   the weight of the film lies on the two leads   and they do a phenomenal job    some of the best acting of this genre   and some of the best acting of the year    two other essential aspects of the film are quite good    director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors   but the second half of the film loses believability   especially during the revelation of the killer    he also doesn t handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have   losing a lot of tension during many scenes    however   to his credit   he does manage a terrific first half    part of the blame falls on david klass    i m sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more   but klass focuses on the two main parts    while this may give the two leads more screentime   many of the small characters are one dimensional   and the killer   when revealed   is extremely implausible    thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel   kiss the girls always seems intelligent    none of the conversations are laughable   and all move the plot forward without seeming forced    one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer    i blame this mainly on the casting director   because the killer s motive is because of rejection from women   or so i assume from the opening monologue     but the killer himself is very attractive   one of my friends is a   shall we say   big admirer of the killer      kiss the girls is rated r for terror   violence   language   and suggested sex    with all the implausibilities of this film   and with the mediocre second half   kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain    in fact   i had the urge to see it again just for the performances    the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone   and the script is usually smart    this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through    morgan freeman is possibly today s most convincing actor   and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt    i must also say that i loved the ending    the showdown between good and evil was quite tense   and the resolution of the

1480	1	saving private ryan   dreamworks   running time   2 hours 48 minutes    starring tom hanks   edward burns   tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the  greatest war movie ever made     saving private ryan is an harrowing   saddening and riveting movie    it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion   but it s certainly one of the best war movies made   and one of the best of 1998    tom hanks stars as a captain who s troop has to find private ryan   damon   who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action    action   drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him    after the disappointing amistad   1997   spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie    i m not the war movie genre biggest fan   but i found this film to be gripping   and very scary   thanks to the excellent cast   direction and terrifying battle scenes    tom hanks is superb   straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles   such as in forrest gump   1994      this time   he plays the role with gritty realism   and is much better for it    occasionally he overacts the sentimentally   but he generally delivers a fine performance    edward burns   looking a lot like armageddon s ben affleck   also delivers a top notch performance   moving away from his roles in films such as she s the one   1996   tom sizemore makes less of an impact   but is still watchable   and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today    spielberg directs very well   putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes    and what battle scenes they are    they re truly terrifying   yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen    the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand held camera   and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique    the gore and violence isn t spared either   which body parts flying   and blood spurting    this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults    other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90 s film making    the cinematography is excellent   and the music score by john william s is also superb    it is never intrusive   and adds to the drama on screen    but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan   there s one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film   the writing    it is unusually flat   with many of the speeches strangely weak    the film never really makes any profound statements    this is not a major gripe   as private ryan is a film of action   not words    still   the script could of been a lot better    thankfully   the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines    saving private ryan   in the end   is an excellent film   but not the  greatest war movie  due to it s weak acting    this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it   as it s rewarding and extremely worthwhile    it really shouldn t be missed   and dreamworks skg has finally found it s first hit movie

1929	1	tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently    the dalai lama has made speaking tours   tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops   the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months       kundun       presence     a name the monks call the young dalai lama   opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader    a group of monks enters a village and a two year old child catches their attention    the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as   mine      he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country    he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950    the peaceful and isolated country is ill equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results    eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india    comparisons to   seven years in tibet   are inevitable    both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner s point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt       kundun   features only native actors and is more of an insider s story    in some ways   this makes this film a superior concept   but it lacks the movement and spark that made   seven years   such an audience pleaser    the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie   filmed in morocco for obvious reasons      the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer generated character    on an intellectual level   it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts    some events are depicted differently and pitt s austrian mountain climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama s life isn t even mentioned here    glossed over in   seven years     the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses   we were just about to change things   after the chinese attack    the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins    his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail    especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain    the visual treats more than make up for the movie s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience    walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience    martin scorsese   known for his dark tales of the underworld     goodfellas       taxi driver       casino     has shifted gears    something of a thematic follow up to his   the last temptation of christ     this is his slowest film yet    oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese   most of these events take place off screen    his decision to not over explain rituals is commendable    the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon fed interpretations    philip glass s score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting    i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again    hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india   i was struck by what was missing in the movie    as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is   there is a distance between the audience and the movie    the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings    with the exception of a few scenes   involvement with the characters is slight    one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama   shown as a mischievous boy who can t resist being a kid sometimes    an encounter with his older brother thubten j   norbu   a retired indiana university professor   who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment   but there aren t many of these    even with its problems   the   kundun   experience is phenomenal   but one that i fear most will miss    many people who saw   seven years in tibet   will have a   been there   done that   attitude    it s likely that the film will miss a wide spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping

1101	1	call it touched by a demon    gregory hoblit s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual   horrific twist    if marketed properly   this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim   dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven    in fact   there s even a little twin peaks to be found here   albeit with the lion s share of the weirdness distilled out       remember bob      the biggest failing of fallen is that   although it s consistently interesting   it s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope    a serial killer   elias koteas   has been on the loose in philadephia   but detective john hobbes   denzel washington     the noblest man on the police force   has brought him to justice    now   during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber   the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes     what goes around really goes around      shortly thereafter   he begins to sing   time is on my side   as he s taken on his last walk    minutes later   the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead    but for hobbes   the nightmare is just beginning   because reese wasn t a normal psychopath   he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel    and   with reese s death   azazel is free to hop from body to body   murdering and wreaking havoc at will    only hobbes and a pretty   female theology teacher   embeth davidtz   have an inkling of what they re up against    the rest of the cops   including hobbes  partner   jonesy   john goodman     lou   james gandolfini     a newcomer to the department   and lieutenant stanton   donald sutherland     don t have a clue   and   as a result   they are in mortal danger    as depicted by hoblit   primal fear   and cinematographer newton thomas sigel   philadelphia is a dark   dreary place   a gothic city rather than a modern one    no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown    the most famous landmark to appear isn t the liberty bell or independence hall   it s geno s steaks    shadows and night scenes abound    the days are cloudy and unpromising    this is the kind of setting where it s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men    fallen s plot is brimming with potential   not all of which is realized    somehow   i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise    but the level of terror   like that of gore   is kept in check    nevertheless   there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks    the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual    of the several dozen actors to play azazel   the best is by far elias koteas   exotica   crash     who   despite only being on screen for about ten minutes   gives a fantastically charged performance    john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself   although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick    sadly   however   these two are the only ones who excel    everyone else   including denzel washington   is boring    washington s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film    it s not that he s bad per se   but he s not very interesting    there s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character   and that keeps us distanced   however slightly   from hobbes    as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop   and as his life or death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate   i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was    washington s subdued approach is part of the reason for this   i never felt a sense of urgency    however   at least washington was believable   which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz   schindler s list   and donald sutherland    to be fair   the flaws in their characters aren t all acting related   neither stanton nor gretta milano are well written    that said   however   there s nothing inspired about either davidtz s or sutherland s work    both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts   as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi dimensional individual    narratively   fallen has a few glaring weaknesses    although the plot proceeds with a convoluted   game like structure   it uses a denzel washington supplied voiceover to overexplain matters    at times   this is actually helpful   and it has a use beyond the obvious   but there are occasions when ponderous lines like   i like the night   sometimes you come face to face with yourself   become a little hard to swallow    in addition   fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland   generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel    however   despite the negatives   i m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending   which i loved    the final scenes are startling   audacious   and unexpected    it s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did    at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes   fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself    this is not a great motion picture   but   considering how bad most january releases are   it s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours    and   whatever you do   don t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll

1024	1	a fully loaded entertainment review   website coming in july     from ace ventura to truman burbank   jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic   yet sympathetic   characters    1996 s the cable guy was supposed to be his big   breakthrough   role from zany humor into darker   more dramatic acting    as most everyone knows   the results were   well   less than stellar    not only did the film not do so hot at the box office   but it was also panned by critics    as far as i know   gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it    the first time i saw the cable guy   in theatres   i was in super critic mode   and didn t really like it    however   due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day   i ve had time to lean back   relax   and take in the film    and to my surprise   it grew on me    the plot is rather simple   broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy   played by carrey   then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship    see   steven s been having some problems with his girlfriend   robin   leslie mann     and he doesn t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend    also   some of the cable guy s antics have been creeping him out    carrey   as the cable guy   gives steven various aliases   which later we find out are all tv characters   larry tate   chip douglas   ricky ricardo   etc   he apparently lives in his cable van   and while many critics didn t enjoy this newer   darker   less manic performance from carrey   i thought it was interesting and rather well done    for me   its not the movie as a whole that s enjoyable   but rather several individual scenes   a karaoke jam at steven s apartment   a medieval fight at a theme restaurant   and a bathroom beating   a la liar   liar     just to name a few    perhaps the fact that more of carrey s humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny    and if you really want to see something   you ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane s   somebody to love     sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam    the cable guy has its bad spots   like most any movie    i didn t particularly like steven s girlfriend   and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend    also   the ending   while having you fooled for a moment   is rather contrived   and somewhat dissapointing    still   i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture   if you re at the video store and can t think of anything to rent   i suggest you try it out    or if you have hbo   just wait till it comes on   you won t have to wait long      hell   that s what i do every day

1471	1	       it s certainly more than just a monster story          kenneth branagh   director actor co writer of mary shelley s frankenstein    kenneth branagh s new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world   including the most controversial version of them all   directed by james whale    the dark and stormy nights   the lightning bolts   the charnel houses of spare body parts   the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful    but the center of the film   quieter and more thoughtful   contains the real story    horror fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror    branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues   morality   philosophy and human elements of the story   and not on old fashioned horror cliches    his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel    the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean    the year is 1794    a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters    his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs    as the ice closes around his ship   a figure appears on the horizon    it s a man    exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew    his name is victor frankenstein   kenneth branagh   and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown    the myserious stranger begins his tale   or more precisely his confession   in geneva   1773    he is remembering his childhood and youth    laughter   banquets and parties   a happy life   without troubles or concerns    here victor lived with his father   ian holm     mother   cherie lunghi     his surrogate sister   helena boham carter   and his servants in happiness and harmony    this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed    like thunder from a quite sky   his mother dies   giving birth to his youngest brother    shocked   baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair   victor   already interested in science   becomes obsessed with death    standing on his mother s grave he says     oh mother     you  did not have to die       no one should ever die       i  will stop this     i  promiss        after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished   victor travels to ingolstadt   in presuite of a medical career    after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night   creating life from death    composing dead bodies   frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man   both physically and mentally    with strong electrical impulses   he managed to breeth life into his creation    the result was ugliness    realizing what he has done   frankenstein tried to undo his work   but it was to late    the creature has escaped    because of the epidemic   frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home   making plans for the wedding    for a while everything is as it was before his mother s death    but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously        whale s picture   although powerful   never managed to capture the total depth of the novel    brannagh has more or less done that    another thing is characters and actors    branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast    the greatest performances comes from de niro   the monster   that has been played by   among others   charles ogle   karloff   lon chaney   bela lugosi   glenn strange   christopher lee   fred gwynne   as herman munster     and now   robert de niro    alone   hated and feared   he is completely aware of his ugliness    at first he is like a helpless   abandoned child   desperately reaching out for love    later when he reads frankenstein s journal   and learns that he is composed of dead bodies   his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge    he is capable of killing without regret       i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground         and  then i slowly crushed his neck       and  as i killed him   i saw your face        that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator    and yet   he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable     for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all      rarely has a cinematic interpretation of   the daemon   approached the level of three dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel    another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein    in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster   god knows why     with the power of an electrical storm    almost no time was granted on his charecter   who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel    here   branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein   establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death   sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment   and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene    branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character    on the outside he is strong   ambitious and talented scientist   but deep down he is unsecure   fragile and vaulerble   constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past    helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein s surrogate sister   who at the end becomes his wife for a little while   before death drives them apart    the rest of the cast   playing secondary characters   is solid and nothing less than convincing    visually the film is stunning   especially the makeup      the spinning camera   the constantly building up musical acore   the art direction   the production design   the costumes are all magnificent   from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests   to the plague riddled streets of ingolstadt   mary shelley s frankenstein is a wonder to behold    kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare         all  i once loved lies in a shallow grave         by  my hand          and the film ends exacly as hamlet   when the creature sets both his and his creator s body on fire    the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness    and a terrifying last close up on the creature s smiling face    can a man create life   then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him    to whom are its actions then attributable   the creature or the being who brought about its existence    shelley did not answer these questions   but she certainly posed them    following her example   branagh does the same    his film is a tragic saga about playing god    victor frankenstein is not an evil man    he wanted to change the world to the better    in this he represents everything science stands for   acting without doubts   never considering the consequences of his actions    produced by francis ford coppola   frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film   dracula      in comparison   i can say that   dracula   has visuals that even   frankenstein   can not live up to    but when it comes to story   characters and casting     frankenstein   is stronger    but stronger than both of them   on every aspect   is neil jordan s   interview with the vampire      although the film is not perfect   the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective     these minor faults are easily forgivable   as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating    branagh has probably created one of the best   if not the best   adaptions of shelly s classic novel

1383	1	bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one    the screenplay   written by co star steve martin   skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science fiction movies to chop socky fight sequences   and all in a crafty and accomplished manner    anyone who knows of   or has had any association with movie making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it s entire duration    the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one    bobby bowfinger   martin     a cheapskate and small time hollywood producer   has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so    a new script   an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain   has caught bowfinger s eye    after confronting a big name producer named jerry renfro   robert downey jr     in a restaurant   an agreement is made to finance the movie    but first   bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey   eddie murphy   to sign in on the project    kit turns the offer down immediately   but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film    after emptying out his life savings   the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved   and then prepares to film the movie without the star s knowledge    the actors confront ramsey on the street   saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage    the unknowing star   who is terrified of aliens and being abducted   is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him    when the conditions become even more treacherous   bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look alike named jiff   also murphy     a sweet natured dork who runs for coffee in between shooting vital scenes    these include attempting a suicide run across an 8 lane freeway   and one of the  hot  scenes involving supporting actress daisy   heather graham   removing her blouse    bowfinger takes it s sweet time getting started   but when the plot switches into high gear   great things happen    certain scenes are so precisely executed   perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall down funny    no   hilarious    standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey   who s supposed to be being followed   keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise   it s actually bowfinger s dog in high heels      and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung fu sequence   featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas    while the entire 97 minutes of bowfinger isn t always on target   individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles    masterful comedy director frank oz   dirty rotten scoundrels   in and out     who has never made a bad movie   ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin s sharp edged script    however   the real on screen star is eddie murphy    this is the actor s finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80 s    murphy excels at every corner   not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey   but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well    these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise   and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs    steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger   but murphy fuels it    this is a summer time comedy that   unlike something such as american pie and south park   doesn t break any rules    but it s still just as uproarious   or perhaps even more side splitting than anything we ve seen this season    the supporting cast   including christine baranski as a work loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman   all perform well within their limits    the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham   as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top    graham   attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers  girl in ap2   displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay    i wouldn t be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain   but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough    
1434	1	based on the relatively unknown   in comparison to spider man   marvel comic book   blade tells the story of half vampire half human   played by wesley snipes   who was born of a vampire s latest meal    now swearing vengeance against all vampires   blade hunts them all    his latest challenge is his biggest though       he  must stop the vampire deacon frost   played by stephen dorff   from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires    admitedly   comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums   often viewed as juvenile by most standards   even seen as illiterate by some    judging by a series of poorly recieved   financial and critical   comic book based films   such as batman and robin   steel   barb wire   the crow   city of angels   and the list goes on     one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film    to some degree   i agree with this sentiment    having read comic books since the age of nine   i m 21 right now   i can count the number of good comic book based movies   not including japanese manga   one hand   1   the crow   1994     2   batman   1989     3   superman   4   the mask   and now    5   blade         men in black   is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book    why is this    for the most part   it is because the filmmakers understand  the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match    the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere   which the director provided    the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics   which the casting and cg effects reflect    superman  is not over the top with colour and flash   and the film reflects this    blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film   creating an appropriate atmosphere    this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher s contrived vision in batman and robin   reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960 s television show    batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact   comics have grown up   and so has the audience   i m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i m ready      which brings me back to blade    although he may be a familiar character to some   due to his appearances in the spider man animated show on fox   one will find no single trace of the warm and fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon    the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that  uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends    the end results are not pretty by any means    the story elements work very well    for a comic book story    screenwriter david goyer   who also wrote the crow   incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore   using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films    this is presented through karen   a hematologist portrayed by n bushe wright    this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires    add this  to the neat little gadgets that blade uses   including a titanium sword complete with an   anti theft device       and one has an interesting premise    however   the film works best as an action film    actor wesley snipes has  an extensive background in martial arts   most of which comes from capoeira   a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks     choreographing every single move    proving that quick   flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences   see batman and robin for a  good example of that     wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes    regardless   this film is far from perfect    the film suffers from at least one major plot hole   regarding the summoning of the blood god    the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on  marked squares   yet one of them is viciously murdered   allowing the ritual to pass   and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square      obvious continuity errors also surface   especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame   there is no trace of smoke either      much of the special effects are not that spectacular either    while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch   other cgi   computer generated imagery   effects are almost slapped together   which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released   the film s release date was pushed back multiple times      scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake   knocking the believability factor down a few notches   but then   i m really hard to impress      the film s r rating comes from gory violence   but the lack of  realism made me wonder why it got such a rating   for realistic violence    watch   saving private ryan        the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin   both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi    still   scenes involving non cgi special effects do surface   and look much more impressive     such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade s sword without deactivating the   anti theft device      wesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess    while not talking much   he is a grand physical presence   leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust    a decent   by comic book film standards   storyline also helps

301	0	8mm   written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker   has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery    nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles   who is asked by upper class toff mrs   christian   myra carter   to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe    the movie happens to be an mythical  snuff movie    where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed    all mrs   christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not    welles agrees   and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies   with video clerk max california   phoenix   as his guide    although the  snuff  industry hasn t really been examined in mainstream cinema   8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most    the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing   although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away    8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much   and apart from a few moments   most of the action in the film is nothing you haven t seen from another standard thriller    the cast help towards the entertainment   apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage    while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona   1987     ever since leaving las vegas   1995     cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot   such as in the terrible snake eyes   1998      here   in 8mm   he s boring   uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice    and in this overlong thriller   these virtues do not help keep the suspense up    only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving   as phoenix is a true talent    his performance is a great break away from the gloom   and he s just purely enjoyable to watch    catherine keener is completely wasted as cage s wife   although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves    her character   though   is hugely underwritten   one of the most wasted characters of the year    also fun is fargo s peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director    as this film is written by the person behind seven   8mm is filled with doom and gloom   and no one appears to know how to use an light switch    unlike seven   8mm isn t too clever   and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives    lacking the strong characters seven featured   8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise   and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment    but director joel schumacher   the completely wrong guy for the job   puts style over content   and while the direction and look are good   it s just not very disturbing    schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience   and though we are meant to be looking at the  dark belly  of the porn industry   it doesn t exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind   which misses the point    also   the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed   so cliched   it s amazing to think it s the same film you re watching    8mm is far from an success   a  snuffed  opportunity    with a boring lead character    controversial  scenes that manage not to be controversial   and a director obsessed with looks   what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller    ultimately   8mm is probably worth renting on home video   unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like    and trust me   the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it    
1960	1	the calendar year has not even reached its midway point   but that hasn t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar bait season    bille august s high profile adaptation of victor hugo s classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic  handsome production values   strong performances by a top notch cast   a literate screenplay  with one critically missing element   emotional sweep    for those not familiar with hugo s original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired   the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th century french set version of the fugitive    after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread   the brutish jean valjean   liam neeson   is paroled    immediately upon release   he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night   he is caught by authorities   only to be forgiven by the bishop   who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow    that he does   and in doing so breaks his parole   which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert   geoffrey rush     who was one of the guards in valjean s prison camp   on his trail    thematically   however   les miserables is a story about redemption   which valjean finds through his dealings with two women   the hard luck factory worker turned prostitute fantine   uma thurman     and her illegitimate daughter   cosette    years after breaking parole   valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau   where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert    valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette   mimi newman   from her cruel caretakers   the thenardiers   and raise the child as his own    the   father   and   daughter   eventually land in paris   where the teenage cosette   claire danes   falls for dashing student revolutionary marius   hans matheson      the decades spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of   and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english language work   following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year s stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla s sense of snow    he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace    production designer anna asp   costume designer gabriella pescucci   and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast    neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable   rush s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated   oscar winning theatrics in shine   and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role    the younger members of the cast fare less well    danes is convincing as cosette   but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction   and matheson   while competent   is a less interesting robert sean leonard    as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is   by the time les miserables was over   my emotions had only been superficially involved    while i was touched by valjean s relationships with fantine and cosette   i was not moved    not even reaching the   touching   level is the cosette marius pairing    my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical   as i am sure many others  is     and i was dismayed to see eponine   a friend of marius s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him   almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation   the daughter of the thenardiers   here she is only briefly seen as a child      her presence would have added some much needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance   but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine   fantine   was enough    even so   as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season   les miserables is a thoughtful   well made   entertaining film   one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no brainers invade the multiplex    
382	0	i want to be involved in show business one day    and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse    this movie proves it for me    i was a little worried about the last batman film   as i thought joel schumaccer   taking over from tim burton   would screw it up    i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne    they didn t    kilmer did a good job   and the cast was left to carry the movie   which they did   even jim carrey as the riddler and i can t stand jim carrey     because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles    this film is different    the cast is still impressive   but here   not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction   he s one of those directors who s good with actors   terrible with camera angles     but writer akiva goldsmith doesn t really give an impressive cast anything to do    the cast is impressive   clooney is a surprisingly good wayne batman   o donnell is a crafty robin as usual   they could ve casted somebody better as batgirl   my friend likes neve campbell     but silverstone is not bad   and thurman is a good poison ivy    the major problem is schwarzenegger   who is a terrible freeze    his accent is so heavy   you can t understand what he says   and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act   and they know it   but they figure that if they flex their muscles   say a limited amount of stuff   and kill a bunch of guys   then they figure nobody ll notice    that s the trouble with me     i   notice    schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney   or as much money as he got for this   but hollywood thinks he does    patrick stewart was the person i d heard that was considered to play freeze   and he would ve been so much better    or sean connery   but not arnold   i m not an actor   but i play one in real life   schwarzenegger    i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film   but it would ve been nice if they d casted a star that had talent for the role    akiva goldsmith s screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film    in a regular batman film   they d concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more   but elle macpherson s julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is    there is talk of a fifth batman movie    my interest to see it is low   but i hope it s better than this    if you don t want to waste your time   rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster    any other    
1311	1	people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels   stories   comic books or movies    often science fiction aficionados find material   previously labelled as science fiction   to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror   or rather simple techno thriller    in such cases   mistakes are understandable   genre boundaries are never clearly marked    but   i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic    such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago   when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff   1983 film directed by philip kaufman    the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits    but the right stuff film isn t even fiction    it was based on the non fiction book by tom wolfe   covering the early years of american space program    the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base   major test site for experimental planes    the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier    many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado    but one quiet pilot   chuck eager   played by sam shaped   succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots   determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records    ten years later   soviets have launched   sputnik   marking the beginning of the space age    in order to regain national prestige   us government decides to be the first to send man into space    best air force   navy and marine pilots are recruited into program   but not yeager   because he lacks college education and desired all american image    in one of critics  polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s    such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman s film looks quite atypical for its time    with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s   age when hollywood used to make films larger than life    but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker    philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original   memorable movies    the right stuff was the last of them   swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual   risk taking   artsy   projects    the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film    the plot is almost non existent and not very coherent   the story   featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes   shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots   embodied in yeager   to new generation of the astronauts    the film also lacks conventional protagonist   yeager   who also appears in small cameo   remains the true hero of the film   but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives   making this movie into ensemble piece    that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents   until that specialised only for bit or character roles    sam shepard is great as yeager   war hero whose greatest achievement   breech of the sound barrier   remained obscured in history books   probably due to his own modesty    on the surface   he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues   but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases    shepard s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean cut marine   and future politician   john glenn    young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper   and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom   superbly played by fred ward    always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and   arguably   first american man in space alan shepard    kaufman left room for female talents to excel too   barbara hershey   pamela reed   veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots  wives    royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher   but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice president lyndon b   johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch    great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman s superb direction    most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time    the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert   as virtual unknowns   far away from strict rules and discipline    everything seems natural  yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world    in that setting   it s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights    but the times are changing   ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war   and   natural   pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined   conventional pilots    their entire lives become focus of media frenzy   and their job is subjected to strict rules   meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats   publicity seeking politicians and uncaring scientists   like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun   played by scott beach   only to preserve their most basic human dignity    this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence   while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity     mercury   astronauts receive fame and fortune   although some of them even before going in the space    those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman s superb use of poetic movie language    editing is great   and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion   the same image would be copied in many latter films      although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military   which provided authentic locations and period equipment   he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights    those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space    another fine contribution of this film is   oscar    awarded musical score by bill conti   i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it    it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy    some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period    this film is great   and its cult status is well deserved   but there are some minor flaws    some of the   mercury   astronauts aren t fleshed out enough   although being played by fine actors   like lance henriksen      film also lacks proper closure    on the other hand   most logical conclusion of the film   landing on the moon   would require this film to be more than six hours long    also   some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians   who were portrayed as evil monsters   just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan s america    in some of contemporary interviews   kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible   and in order to do that   he portrayed russians not as they were in real life   but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s    time has passed   now we don t see astronauts as heroes    in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions   those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers    few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up    but this film   sentimental reminder of the times   when future began     perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow   mercury   astronauts  footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky    and even if they

1748	1	   dimension films     scream 2    s distributor   has asked press to say extremely little    if anything    about the film s twisty plot    that s no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here   but i will do my best to be vague   now   there s a first           the first one was  good    but all the rest sucked     said a cinematically savvy teen in last winter s wes craven thriller   scream     her statement referring to the films of the   nightmare on elm street   series but really putting down franchise overkill in general    the comment certainly carries clout   for every truly great sequel   there appears to be a couple of duds   making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas    but like it or not   along comes   scream 2     and believe it or not   it s a doozy    a slick   sinister   madly subversive good time at the movies   as intent on sending up hollywood s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions       scream 2   is definitely that rare movie thing    a follow up that can stand along side its original with pride    it s been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch esque get ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro   california    those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives    plucky heroine sidney prescott   neve campbell   is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college   her pop culture whiz pal randy meeks   jamie kennedy   has tagged along    trash tabloid reporter gale weathers   courteney cox   has written a best seller based on their ordeal   the basis of which has been turned into a   very bad   movie called   stab      and dewey riley   david arquette     still suffering from wounds inflicted during   scream     has left his job as a police officer for a while    life is tranquil        at least for a while    several sudden murders bring sidney   randy   gale and dewey together again   but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings    if these four people learned anything from the past   it s to trust no one    thus   the possible victim potential killer list includes said quartet   as well as   derek   jerry o connell     sidney s new beau   cici   sara michelle gellar     a chatty sorority gal   joel   duane martin     gale s cameraman who s not too thrilled with her blood soaked past   hallie   elise neal     sidney s sassy roommate   debbie   laurie metcalf     a local reporter who gives gale some not too friendly competition   and mickey   timothy olyphant     randy s good friend and fellow film student    cotton weary   liev schreiber     the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother s murder in scream   also shows up on campus    but why    like the first scream   craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang    this time   it s an extended sequence that finds an african american couple   jada pinkett and omar epps   attending a sneak preview of   stab     making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non roles of blacks in slasher cinema    before tragedy ensues at the screening   the movie within a movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments   including a scene from   stab   which turns scream s now famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear         b       hang up the phone and star 69 his a        pinkett yells at the screen      it s funny   creepy stuff   i don t think i ll ever feel safe in a movie theater again   that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road    another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone assault of the killer on randy   dewey and gale in broad daylight   it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters    there are other superb set pieces   but explaining them risks ruining their effect    there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count    it s something of a trade in    the new characters are too large in number to be as fully developed as the original   scream   gang   but this movie packs in knowing performances   especially by kennedy and cox   and more death for your dollar    it can be argued that   while the original might outclass it by a tad   scream 2 is both scarier and funnier    it certainly doesn t skimp with shocks    a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart   i actually questioned craven and williamson s judgment here   considering how much this person has added to these films      sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab    the two scenes we re shown are dead on    but for film fans   there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like   the usual suspects       aliens   and   the empire strikes back      still     scream 2   does so many things right   it s petty to quibble    its penchant for parody is irresistible   discussions of the merits of film sequels and all    the attractive   solid cast is a definite bonus    and the denouement   while not as shocking as   scream    s   is priceless   the film s final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in   scream   with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper    all this and a   scream 3   is in the works    knowing the series  tendency for self reference   perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice    mentioning   scream 2    ll help them in their argument    
695	0	i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films    when done right   with at least slightly evident restraint   they can be engaging   sweeping   appealing    but it s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle   a hollow   boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers   the ones willing to buy into ephron s whiny views of life and romance    tom hanks and meg ryan   two of hollywood s most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed   repectively    baldwin s wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son   jonah   seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse    jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems    sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show   but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out    ephron has him do this so that annie reed   meg ryan   can hear it    annie is a happy woman    she is engaged to walter   an allergy prone working man and seems to be perfectly content    but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show   she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it    five years after this movie hit theaters   hanks   ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better   although still sub par romantic comedy you ve got mail   which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet    at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity    here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five    the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory    sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers   from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o donnell    but none of them can save the film from being a bore    its characters are dull and empty   its script isn t funny or particularly charming    the script has a fundamental problem   annie gives up   for little reason   her life with walter to pursue   sleepless in seattle     whom she has never even seen    it s the kind of life decision that real people don t make   and its a major   unforgivable plausibility sacrifice    in essence   this movie s purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn t even exist    it s a ten minute short film with ninety five minutes of filler    if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn t have to review it   you could just call me   asleep in philadelphia         1999 eugene novikov  137

233	0	by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer   it s possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one    action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup    audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film s sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending   which is an insulting cop out    somewhere out there   maybe there s a small cadre of film goers who will appreciate sphere s dubious charms   but i m not among them    i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie   i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham     because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by   it s hard to understand why the rights were optioned    sphere is the kind of first  class mess that only a top line director with an a list cast can create    with expectations high   and how could they not be   considering that another barry levinson dustin hoffman collaboration   the excellent wag the dog   is still playing in theaters        something this bad can t help but look even worse    the last time a big name   big budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year s batman   robin   and everyone knows how that movie was received    sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron s the abyss   but   somewhere along the way   it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort   event horizon    science and philosophy   which are used to good effect during sphere s first hour   give way to mindless   confusing action sequences    attempts at characterization fall apart    intelligent writing   which is evident early on   is replaced by hackneyed drivel    special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness    but all that is just in preparation for the ending   which is inexcusably awful    this is the time honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect    i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film    there is some promise   but it s all in the setup    we re introduced to norman goodman   dustin hoffman     a psychologist who once wrote a  35   000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered    when one is found in the middle of nowhere   1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean   norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee    on the team with him are beth halperin   sharon stone     a biochemist who was once his student and lover   harry adams   samuel l   jackson     a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18   ted fielding   liev schreiber     an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology   and harold barnes   peter coyote     the government operative in charge of the mission    together   the five descend into the bowels of the ocean   where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact    for a while   sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man meets alien situation    the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists   such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship   apparently from the future   offer intriguing possibilities    then   right around the one hour mark   that s the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever s left of titanic     the virtually non stop action begins   and   once it starts   the script becomes superfluous    this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension   but   instead   he relies on loud   overbearing music   strange camera angles   and quick cuts to make things   exciting      additionally   because none of the characters are well formed   a common failing in anything penned by crichton   who s more interested in technology than people     viewers don t develop much of a rooting interest    it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience    what about that a list cast    not surprisingly   the most energetic performance is given by samuel l   jackson   but his harry isn t a person   he s a walking plot device spouting occasionally witty dialogue    dustin hoffman isn t lively or particularly good    it s ironic that this   which may be his worst work in a decade   has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination   for wag the dog      sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat    their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion   automatons would have been as effective    then there s queen latifa   who   despite getting fifth billing in the credits   ahead of liev schreiber   who boasts at least quadruple her screen time     has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count    i like to think that levinson and hoffman   recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be   chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance   the low budget picture was filmed during sphere s lengthy pre production phase      if that s the case   forgiveness is granted    i m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton   although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume   jurassic park and the levinson directed disclosure come to mind      even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process   crichton s credit as a producer disallows him absolution    he was a willing participant in a creative travesty    no wonder sphere is being released in february   in the midst of the early year s cinematic wasteland    it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic   which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth consecutive weekend atop the box office heap

1467	1	   rebel without a cause   is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to    everyone feels that they are different in some way   that they don t belong in some places and   rebel without a cause   successfully shows on screen these universal emotions    no matter what generation you belong to   these feelings are present    this is why james dean is admired by america   because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute    in our minds   we just try to do the right thing just like dean s jim stark does    not only does   rebel without a cause   display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure    each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection    this is because times change and in response people change    no matter how popular you were once   as your generation grows older   newer breeds look at you in a different light    this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents    even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past   the teens could not believe this    in one humorous scene   stark   his girlfriend judy   natalie wood     and his pal plato   sal mineo   pretend they are adults    they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored    this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another    speaking on behalf of my generation   i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by    the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation   same  goes for brando   redford   even deniro    i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon   ben affleck   and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century    will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten    any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film    even if   rebel without a cause   has some ridiculous scenes   the game of chicken   did people really act this way       an unbelievable conclusion   how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end       and a silly romance   wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours   it still is a fabulous film    the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool    now   however   the coolness is fading        
1878	1	usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock    others will mention meg ryan    but for me   it s not even close    janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy   she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now    and it s a good thing she s starring in the matchmaker   because without her presence the movie would be bland   unfunny   and dull    garofalo stars as marcy tizard   a top aide to boston senator john mcglory   who is suffering in the polls    in an attempt to capture the irish vote   he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory s that never moved to america    unfortunately for marcy   her visit coincides with the town s annual matchmaking festival    things get off to a rocky start for marcy though    she has no hotel reservations   for no rational reason   and the tiny confined room   tired old cliche    she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub    his name is sean   and marcy finds him repugnant at first   so you can obviously tell where this is headed    the movie runs into a few roadblocks    for instance   the story is very thin    none of the characters   except the old local matchmaker   are nearly as interesting as garofalo    some of the characters   like the political aide played by denis leary   have wandered in from a completely different movie    i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery   and several close ups of garofalo s winning smile    the strange thing is that it works    garofalo s charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories   and it carries this one

729	0	girl 6 is   in a word   a mess    i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film    there was no sense of where the film was going   or any kind of coherent narrative    if there was a point to the film   i missed it    girl 6   by the way   is the way theresa randle s character is addressed in the phone sex workplace   all the girls are known by their numbers    the plot   such as it is   theresa randle is a struggling n   y   actress   and eventually takes a job as a phone sex operator    she begins to lose contact with reality   as her job consumes her    also   she must deal with the advances of her ex husband   isiah washington      he is an ex  con thief   and she tries to keep him away   while at the same time   it s clear that she still harbors feelings for him    her neighbor   jimmy   spike lee   functions as the observer   mediating between the ex  husband and girl 6    he also functions as a point of stability   as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex    the soundtrack   consisting of songs by prince   was jarring    it kept taking my attention from the film   not altogether a bad thing   i ll grant you   as what was transpiring onscreen wasn t that riveting    for parts of the middle of the film   the music stayed blissfully in the background    in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film   however   the music was particularly loud and distracting    of course   i ve never really cared for prince s   or tafkap if you like   music    prince fans might love the soundtrack   but it will probably be distracting   even to die hard fans    of the performances   the only one that stood out was spike lee s buddy character   jimmy    he was excellent as the always broke neighbor of girl 6    he should have stuck to acting in this film    there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he d like to be oliver stone when he grows up    there are scenes shot with different types of film   which are purposely grainy   and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone s natural born killers    in that film   they worked to propel the narrative    in this film   they just made me more confused    there are some amusing moments   and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone sex industry the multi billion dollar industry that it has become    other than that   though   nothing much happens    there are a few intense moments   as when one caller becomes frightening   but even that is rather lackluster    i m not the biggest fan of spike lee   though i d agree that he has done some very good work in the past    in girl 6   though   he seems to be floundering    he had an interesting idea   a fairly good setup   and seemed to wander aimlessly from there    girl 6 earns a grade of d    
1721	1	with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up   loading their guns   kissing each other and uttering what sounds like   rock and roll         actually   it s   lock and load       you can t help thinking tarantino    and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery   the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie   clyde to natural born killers    but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction   exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run   normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon       inspired by true events      we ve heard that one before   and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated        or so strangely poignant    for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality   who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged    beginning with their final arrest   the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris   luke perry     a policeman   and pam   ashley judd     a factory worker    they fall in love and marry   but pam s increasingly erratic behaviour   going on spending sprees   slashing herself with a knife after an argument   begin to trouble the solid and stable chris    when chris gets sacked   they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up    then   chris begins to rob banks        luke perry accomplishes the not inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer    moustached   with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation   he is perfectly cast as the long suffering husband       it s another of john mcnaughton s coups of casting against type   after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory      but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage   and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness   making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person    if the performance falls short of greatness   however   it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema   whether it s in betty blue   tom   viv or georgia    as in those movies   there s the danger that the performance seems mannered   a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece    judd doesn t entirely avoid this pitfall   but pam s  craziness  is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more  normal  chris    when pam reacts to her father in law s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones   chris  face is the picture of pained restraint    of course   it s the question of what is  normal  that is asked in normal life    mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity    it is the rational chris that loves guns     shooting is about precision   control     and the  crazy  pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog   who is then called chaos      chaos and you and me        we re a real family     she notes wryly      it is chris  methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber   his well planned disguise as a bearded   roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness      in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery   a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background     buy more      the perfectly respectable consumption crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases   and both of them into desperate situations    it s not a perfect film    some of the dialogue is a touch too banal   perhaps intentionally        the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film    indeed   as in mcnaughton s seminal film henry   portrait of a serial killer   it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism   the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre   that gives this determinedly unflashy   moving film its great strengths    mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet   coolly  realistic  method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer    the suburbs   with their miles of white fenced houses and identikit malls   take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness    in its very different way   this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick s badlands    while pam shares the yearnings of malick s heroes to escape from ordinary life   chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a  normal life    their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies    but these are dreams defined by   constrained by   and even doomed by   the limitations of the  normal    conventional world    pam s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs   where wild bushes grow    symbolically the frontier   the outer limits of her society   but also quite literally the end of the road   where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement    the flying inkpot s rating system     wait for the video         a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha           pretty good   bring a friend             amazing   potent stuff               perfection    see it twice

1176	1	no   it is not a bad film   in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose   i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly    event horizon is not your run of the mill sci fi film   i m sure many who have watched this will agree with me    it is not even original in that sense   and it does borrow heavily from films like alien   hellraiser and even blade runner    the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build up that makes it wonderfully horrifying    the story brings us to the year 2050   where space travel have since enormously progressed    the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose   it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man s lifetime    the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years   it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune    a search and rescue team led by miller   fishburne   is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon    the designer of the ship   dr   weir   neill   follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship    event horizon is a sci fi horror film   much truer to the word than say   alien would ever be    while in alien   the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces   in event horizon   the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying    the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb   up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud  enough    i can t stand this anymore        there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime    the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also   the acting is only at most   average by most commercial standards    even so   the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film   thanks to its well paced storytelling   disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences   which incidentally   has been quite generously removed by our censorship board      director paul anderson   who did mortal kombat   and his team of  atmosphere  creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term  horror     this picture did not do very well in the us box office most probably for the dread factor impact it has on most audiences   people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this    although on the face of it   event horizon is mostly molded for mass entertainment   many thrills   spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus    however   the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing    my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the  experience  of event horizon    i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us    be forewarned   this film is not for the faint hearted nor for pure entertainment    be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film    event horizon is highly recommended     but at your own risk    it has been a long time since good horror embraced the big screen   and event horizon is one

imaginative    remember   the robot    it wasn t one at all but rather a   phase one assault cyborsuit      the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors    the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit   and the cyborsuit   nicknamed cy   has plenty of spunk    cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like   cool      upon hearing that   command     cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop    and when cy speaks   we see spencer s view   the backside of cy s lips and eyes    as 12 year old spencer   joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue tied kid    even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit   he has his fears but he learns to overcome them       if you run away   things don t get better   whether it s bullies   spiders   or girls     his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three    turbo   joey simmrin     the school s chubby bully   beats up on him   spiders frighten him   and   most embarrassing of all   he can t speak when in the presence of his would be girlfriend    with his cyborsuit on   he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy    spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey   played by a smart mouthed ashlee levitch   who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker    stacey derides her brother   whom she barely tolerates   by referring to him only as   the fungus      this whole setup for spencer s downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment    the beauty of mazzello s performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he ll not soon forget    the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics   but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing    the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately    when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire   michelle   lauren eckstrom     his eyes open wide in revulsion       mate with her      spencer exclaims       pllllleeeeease   i just like her that s all      the show has many funny twists    in one   cy sees a man in a barney like costume and begins firing at him   thinking he is an alien life form    soon things get way out of hand   and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat    as proof positive of the show s class   it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor    thought that was an oxymoron in a kids  picture   didn t you    cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit   and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious    the director s staging of this sequence is one of the film s more charming moments    oh   and eating is pretty funny too    spencer   whose idol is the comic book character   midknight warrior     gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit    spencer s valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle    and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids  show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition    for a family movie mixing humor   fantasy   and action   star kid delivers    although it s probably not the sort of movie you d want to see without kids   with them you ll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story    you ll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through    star kid runs 1   41    it is rated pg for fantasy combat    although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids   i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening   so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up   and possibly the younger ones    my son jeffrey   age 8   got really excited about the picture    he called it   an especially good movie   and gave it            when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters   he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully

716	0	do the folks at disney have no common decency    they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects   embarrassing writing and kid friendly slapstick    wasn t mr   magoo enough   people    obviously not    inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment    younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness   but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80 minute exercise in glaring stupidity    the movie is poorly edited   grossly manipulative   and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle    all the elements are there   but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite    as a huge fan of the 80 s animated tv show   the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain    in the cartoon   dr   claw was a frightening   raspy voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer    we never saw his face   he simply sat back in his arm chair   watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat    as a child   i always imagined what dr   claw would appear as   and this curiosity kept me watching for many years    with the release of the live action movie   the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed   it s        rupert everett      only now   dr   claw is simply known as claw    one word     he explains    like madonna       he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove   and seems far less interesting than the animated version    it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic   but he overplays the role entirely too far    when all is said and done   this wasn t a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters   the infamous dr   claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool    he does still have his cat   though    in the title role   matthew broderick looks lost    the actor   while usually downright charming   doesn t know exactly where to take his character   a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers    broderick first plays a friendly   naive security guard named john brown   who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people    he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda   joely fisher     who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics    but one fateful night   her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire   everett   who wants to take over the world    john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime   but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames    in a full body cast   he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda s work   a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys    and so is born inspector gadget    as bad as this movie is   it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes    broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget   an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city    and there are about two or three amusing punch lines   the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall   and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming    this is why i left tokyo      alas   the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle    there are so many tired plot additions    gadget s talking car   voiced by d   l    hughley   is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian    both are wisecracking   non human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children    well   it just doesn t work   in fact   zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this      and don t even get me started about the villains    i didn t mind everett s performance   but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust    the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles    penny   michelle trachtenberg   and brain the dog now have little to do with the action   and chief quimby   dabney coleman   has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action    the special effects are everywhere   but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over    the problem here lies solely in the script    perhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this   they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy schmancy visuals    here is one critic crossing his fingers   anyway    
689	0	an american werewolf in london is john landis  groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england    the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects    more specifically   the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf   and for the ghosts that haunt the main character    even twenty years after its release   that part of the movie is still impressive    although   i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive    the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure    if it weren t for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980    and with good reason    the acting isn t great and neither is the writing    well ok   we don t actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film    but one other important element is lacking here too    it isn t scary    with no exception   you know what is going to happen before it happens    you don t even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint    i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen    but john   it just wasn t scary    i didn t know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it   but it didn t work for me    actually   it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films    but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad   the intended humor was lost on me    it s never a good sign that you don t realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material    call me crazy   but you shouldn t have to do research on a movie to enjoy it    i m not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much   since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up    werewolf bites boy   david naughton      boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse   jenny agutter   and then strange things begin to happen to boy    including   and i must admit this is a very nice touch   visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital    the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse    i know it sounds strange   but it actually works    the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy   griffin dunne   are really the best parts of the movie    as i said   probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects    while they are still impressive today   they aren t impressive enough   or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film    and since they are more or less the highlight of the film   there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch    actually   the 1998 sequel   an american werewolf in paris   is more entertaining since it doesn t take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way

1185	1	the thirteenth floor   the third in what i would call   the reality check movie series     is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year   the matrix and existenz    all three made you think   made you wonder what is real   what isn t   and if our world is just a huge game    the thirteenth floor doesn t reach the level of originality   creativity   and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz   but it certainly gives a great shot at it    in the matrix   we were told that the humans are simply a virus    in existenz   we learned that our life could be just a game    in the thirteenth floor   we learn that we are just electronic devices   living under another world of electronic devices    there is just one world on top of another   and everything in them are fake and electronically generated    the thirteenth floor took a huge   risky turn that i didn t expect it to take   and i m not very sure it was such a great turn to make    rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film   the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds    after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller   played by armin mueller stahl   douglas hall   played by craig bierko   a man that worked under fuller for many years   must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using   to the year 1937   which consists of computer generated characters only    the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days    all of the people involved are just characters   or are they    douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours   and killed fuller    along the way   douglas interacts with many different potential suspects   and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller   jane fuller   played wonderfully by a talented young actress   gretchen mol    the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going   and doesn t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer s interests    i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz   and i wouldn t enjoy it   but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film    unfortunately   many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content   letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened    the scenes that aren t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere   leaving you wondering     what is the point of this      sometimes it was hard to believe that this story   with terrible dialogue   some bad acting   especially from craig bierko   and scenes that go absolutely nowhere   are actually true    i know this isn t a true story or anything   but a film should be able to make you think that it is    on the plus side of acting   we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor   armin mueller stahl    in the thirteenth floor   he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances    another plus is gretchen mol s realistic performance   creating her character with depth   not just staying in the one dimensional phase    don t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor   just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile   and shuts you down like any other movie would    thrills   chills   and spills aren t what you will get in this film   but you will just get another trip to send your mind on   scrambling it until you ve had enough    the bottom line  let s hope this is the last of the   reality check   based movies for awhile    
1371	1	sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film    sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride    i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers   most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes    surprised   they may have been   when they realized that this picture actually had something to say    but by the attentiveness of the crowd i d say they were won over   as was i   i can t tell yet if truman really is that good   or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year    time alone will make that call    but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank s side    we were concerned for his well being   and wanted him to win    that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey   who has achieved legitimacy at last    the truman show is a film best viewed cold   with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot    unless you re under a media blackout   however   you probably know the basics    carrey stars as truman burbank   a capra esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl   laura linney   in the south florida island town of seahaven   which looks like michael eisner s idea of the perfect american small town    truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle   complete with a working wife   a best bud   friendly neighbors and interesting co workers    there is tragedy in his past   his father drowned in a horrible boating accident   leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water   and of travel in general   but overall   life is good    but then one day as truman leaves his house for work   a klieg light falls magically from the sky    this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows   that he is a prisoner on the world s biggest soundstage   that his wife   friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him   and that his life has   for over 10   000 days   been broadcast as the world s most popular television program    what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir    the soundstage   we re told   is   only the second man made structure visible from space      truman s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5   000 cameras scattered throughout the town   button cams   dashboard cams   mirror cams   wife cams   big cams and small cams    weir cuts the film so we re never quite sure if we re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show s omnipotent creator christof   ed harris   who oversees the show from a control room built into the man made moon in seahaven s sky    the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence    his best friend marlon   noah emmerich   always has a six pack of beer with him    his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product    he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town    one wonders why he didn t pick up on any of this earlier   but christof has an answer for this     people tend to accept the reality with which they re presented      nevertheless   truman begins to grow restless   and dreams of escape to fiji   where an old college sweetheart   natasha mcelhone   supposedly lives    this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept   the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way    by underplaying truman   he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over    there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon   and marlon answers with best friend sincerity     i d gladly step in front of a bus for you      but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof    the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home   and from that moment   we re on his side    the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies   haven t we all   at least once   doubted our place in the world   doubted the sincerity of those closest to us    ultimately   however   the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator    what does god really think of us    does he resent our abandonment of paradise    who exactly is watching us   up there in the sky    if you enjoy the picture as much as i did   credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work    as for carrey   well   truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play    carrey is no jimmy stewart   to his credit   he doesn t try to be    he just tries to feel the way you or i would   if we suddenly found out

1945	1	if you thought baz luhrmann s radical take on  william shakespeare s romeo   juliet  was wild   wait until what you see what tony award winning stage director julie taymor    the lion king    the broadway musical    does to the bard s  titus andronicus  for her audacious  and very bloody  film debut    while luhrmann transplanted the star crossed lovers to 1990s florida   taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome  but places it in a surreal temporal limbo    the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome   but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s   while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more  40s and  50s   and other garments are more gladiator like    as tamora   queen of goths   jessica lange   exacts revenge on roman general titus   anthony hopkins   for killing her eldest son   and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits   taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story s underlying themes    however   the time convergence approach only works at times   for often it s just distracting   as in one scene where tamora s suviving sons   matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers   blow off steam playing video arcade games    taymor didn t have to resort to such avant garde time tricks   for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them    she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist   the latter compliment encompassing all areas   makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments    she also has a sure way with actors   hopkins  titus is at once tragic and horrifying   and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora    the clear standout of the cast   however   is harry lennix as aaron   a moor who is tamora s secret lover and a schemer in his own right    lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain    a great villain he indeed is   but to leave it at that isn t giving full justice to his powerful and multi dimensional work     titus  isn t a complete success   but it is never less than fascinating   and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice    
371	0	renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean claude van damme on the action star s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman    double team    and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick   stylish   and somewhat diverting action timekiller    tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels    knock off    but this time around   style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous   and at worst incomprehensible   nor hide a host of truly lousy performances    writer steven e   desouza s fairly straightforward plotline isn t as outre as  double team  s strange yarn involving a secret think tank prison   but it makes about as much sense   which is little    van damme plays marcus ray   a hong kong based sales rep for a jeans company       who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip sized bombs in hk product exports to the u   s     dolls   electronic equipment   and   yes   jeans    it s all part of some type of ransom scheme   but all i remember is  and i kid you not  graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world   bombs detonating   and an hat wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter               which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout  knock off     while all of van damme s films have its share of unintentional laughs   mostly due to the stiff acting   skills   of the physically agile van damme    knock off  delivers more than usual   though not as many as van damme s embarrassing directorial effort   1996 s  the quest       a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza     i smoked that badass like a roman candle      and   entrepreneurship   babycakes      standing out among my favorites    but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of  knock off  s laughs    van damme is true to laughable form   perhaps even worse than usual    early scenes actually  require  him to make funny with co star rob schneider   improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus s business partner     and the sight and sound of the still heavily accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way    even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug    paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider s cia superior   and lela rochon   playing an investigator for the jeans company   spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode    in rochon s defense   though   her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs   exquisite bone structure   and perky bosoms   the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage    tsui picks up where he left off visually in  double team    juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work    here   though   tsui s visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill   coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise    for each nifty trick tsui pulls off   such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices   there are others that are completely superfluous    this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context    for instance   one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box    as he puts his hand in   the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen    it s undoubtedly an interesting visual   but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something    the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences   but surprisingly   those in  knock off  leave much to be desired    tsui does what he can to make something of them   employing freeze frames   blurred motion   and unconventional camera angles   but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza    there isn t anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger land mine fight in  double team    let alone anything remotely close to tsui s legendary hong kong works   but that s a given going in      if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo s stateside success   he would do best to break free from van damme        before it s too late    if he continues his involvement with b grade movies such as  knock off    the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish        that is   if it hasn t already disappeared entirely after this fiasco    
1226	1	in 1977   something never though possible happened    the film star wars was released   with extraordinary   never seen before techniques of special effects    the film set a new standard for special effects in film    not only did it set a standard for the special effects   it set a standard for film itself    the plot is one of the most creative i heard ever    the legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi    the jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side    darth vader is the leader of the dark side    ben obi wan kenobi   played by sir alec guinness   was one of those jedi who is still alive today    darth vader was once a jedi   until he turned to the dark side    years after the killing of the jedi   darth vader is still around causing trouble    r2 d2 and c 3p0 are both what we call   driods     or robots that are of assistance to humans    while an attack on the ship that princess leia   played by carrie fisher   is aboard   she inserts a message to r2 d2   who is also on the ship    to obi wan kenobi pleading for help    the princess is captured by vader   but r2 d2 and c 3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine    the jawas   or small creatures who sell droids   pick r2 d2 and c 3p0 up to sell    they are bought by luke skywalker s   mark hamill   family    while luke is cleaning the droids   the message from princess leia is found    luke finds this obi wan kenobi   and learns that obi wan was a friend of luke s father   who is now dead    luke also learns his family was a jedi    after luke s family is killed by tropps from the dark side   ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all    ben wants to create a new jedi    first   the two must find princess leia and serve her    han solo   played by harrison ford   and his sidekick chewbacca   played by peter mayhew   are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary    after meeting up with leia   the film really picks up    luke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi   ben kenobi confronts darth vader   and many other interesting events occur    star wars is an amazing epic    the plot is so original and amazing   i cannot believe it    the special effects   especially for its time   are wonderful and realistic    the space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch    the ships flown by all are very unique and creative    the costumes are also out of this world    the scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before    there are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever    the entire premise of star wars is amazing    the creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind    even the human characters are different    every character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films    the acting on everyone s part is great   especially that of sir alec guinness s    even though the concept is not realistic at all   it is pulled off very nicely    the acting   setting   effects   costumes   and sound make it work    if any of these were messed up   star wars would have come off as one huge joke    the ending works very well   and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward    in early 1997   a special edition of star wars was released    the film was re mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977    a few creatures were added here and there   and even an entire deleted scene with han solo and jabba the hutt   seen in return of the jedi   was added to the film    think that s enough    on may 19   1999   star wars episode i   the phantom menace will be released   followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before a new hope    with this   star wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in our time    
287	0	in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french canadian co production by max fischer    the movie is set in paris where its hero   struggling american author david mirkine   judd nelson   at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity   suffers a terrible writers bloc    he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle   laurence treill      unfortunately   she hangs out in jet set circles   which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous    her connection with powerful david caravan   pierce brosnan   would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events    although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller   drama would probably be more appropriate genre label    pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers   and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments    low budget also becomes painfully visible   and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film    unfortunately   this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes   so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed    instead   they would have to settle with pointless   slow scenes involving nelson   brosnan and laurence treill s attempts of serious acting    all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone s precious time

1899	1	i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of   good will hunting     based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film   in which the main character will hunting   matt damon     an mit janitor in his early twenties   is discovered to be an einstein level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight    the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who s had his share of run ins with the law   and before long he s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight    professor lambeau   stellan skarsgard     who had brought up the math problems in his lectures   tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police   will is to be released   provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions    this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff   but   good will hunting   rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama    a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will s therapist sean mcguire   robin williams     lambeau wants to get will to use his brain   while sean wants him to listen to his heart   both of which he has been largely neglecting    will finds that the former is much easier than the latter   so much so   in fact   that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle    he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar   minnie driver     an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her    what makes   good will hunting   work so well   aside from the strong performances   especially from damon and williams     is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will s life    the script s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau   but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong    lambeau   while he may seem a little cold at times   is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we re not sure if we like what he has to say    and sean   for all his warm heartedness   has   as lambeau and later will point out   not lived up to his full intellectual potential either   the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will    will s reaction to this situation   and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean   is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters  opinions   rather than setting up an obvious   right   and   wrong   side and beating them over the head with it    for a film with such an extraordinary character     good will hunting   presents itself as remarkably ordinary   it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman   a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another    this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama   by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far fetched situation       good will hunting   also has its share of fun humor   such as when will   in an early therapy session   pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture    and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear   will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa    will s relationship with his friends   most notably chucky   ben affleck     is usually rather amusing   if somewhat crude   the film has 100  uses of the  f  word   which was most likely the reason for its r rating     and lends itself well to the development of will s character    add all this to the fact that   good will hunting   even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental   and you might be wondering why i haven t given this film four stars    well   for one thing   no matter how well damon and affleck   who wrote the screenplay   and director gus van sant pull it off   the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original    there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic   including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions    still     good will hunting   takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would   and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years   and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of  97 films

1469	1	catherine deane   jennifer lopez   is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up    she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma   but the boy s parents aren t happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life    as if trying to assure the boy s parents wasn t hard enough on her   a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane s mental faculties    a vicious serial killer named carl stargher   vincent d onofrio   has been kidnapping women   locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days   then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life sized dolls    just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell   stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia    the police   led by fbi agent peter novak   vince vaughn   are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim s body   but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state    in a last ditch attempt   they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher s mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell        a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours    initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix    while it does share some characteristics with both films   particularly the first forty minutes   which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs     the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm    the buzz around this project is that first time feature film director tarsem singh   who won many awards for his video of r   e   m    s   losing my religion     wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story   and a good portion of this film supports that theory    despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments   the cell does feature some remarkable imagery    all of the sequences where we delve into someone s mind are incredibly beautiful   including the dank mind of stargher   whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h   r   giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video     proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe    the first sequence that takes place in stargher s mind is by far the best   featuring one of the most ingenious traps i ve ever seen in a film   involving a horse   which no one seeing this film will probably forget     a zoo like display of stargher s victims which are animated like marionettes   and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room    if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant   but alas   the sequences only become more silly as they go along   despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film      the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images   but at least vincent d onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance   magnified by ten   thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed      in my opinion   d onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film   but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful   i   e      the newton boys   feeling minnesota   the thirteenth floor   and the velocity of gary   that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him    the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though   and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him    detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film   as it contains heavy doses of both    besides the nipple ring removal i mention above   there is also stargher s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs   prior to his catatonia and capture   which will have audiences recoiling    a sequence where catherine enters stargher s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting    one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit like device    as a narrative film   the cell is sorely lacking    as a collection of images though   the cell is extremely well done    although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half   singh has done what he supposedly set out to do   make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together    unfortunately   a well written script should have been considered too   because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv   provided   of course   that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos

439	0	       warning   the following review contains spoilers        cast   gary sinise   don cheadle   connie nielsen   jerry o connell   kim delaney   tim robbins   elise neal   jill teed   jody thompson   bill timoney written by   jim thomas   john thomas and graham yost directed by   brian depalma running time   115 minutes  the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but    gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife   maggie   kim delaney     becomes ill and passes away    don cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot    when a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission   sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them   neilsen   and o connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining    what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever   although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected      before i ever saw the film   i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr   pepper    every time i would see a bottle of the soft drink   the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it    little did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products    dr   pepper saves the day at one point   and a dream sequence flashback features jerry o connell shoving m m s in our face    these are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film    clich   s are also the order of the day with mission to mars    dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style   even independence day   which lifted all of it s premises from other sci fi films was better than this film   and i don t like independence day      films like 2001   a space odyssey   the abyss   and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from   and poorly at that      there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon   and i couldn t help but whisper   u tinni   to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it    this film also features one of my all time least favorite movie clich   s   the   he would have wanted you to have this   moment   where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having   and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on      scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films   but in a film as clich   ridden as this   it is particularly irritating    ennio morricone s music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on   but here it is dreadfully overbearing    his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes    at other times his music is unbearably over dramatic    one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won t reach its intended target    mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme    events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience    we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife   but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest    what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins  character needs to turn himself into a popsicle   except to invoke an emotional response   i could think of at least one way to save him   and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be   smarter   than i am      during the finale   when we are finally introduced to the translucent   conehead   kitty faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from   we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film   just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn      a brief history lesson about   where we came from   is proffered   then sinise is whisked away to be with   the rest of our people     he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that   this is a chance to step foot where no one else has         from the press i ve been seeing this film receive   it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater    i m sure the first weekend or two will be huge   but once word gets out people will stop going    let s just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn t hurt by the negativity this film is generating    i d venture to say it won t be worse than this waste of time     pg   
295	0	alexander dumas  the three musketeers is one of the most often adapted literary works   and for good reason   the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story    perhaps the musketeer   a new film that   reimagines   the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix   is one adaptation too many    it s just awful   spiritless   silly and unforgivably boring   transforming the timeless classic into a mish mash of old as time clich   s and incoherent   repetitive action sequences    this time   d artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers   who can t even pronounce his character s name    as a boy   he watched his father get killed by febre   tim roth     a lackey of power hungry cardinal richelieu    he vowed to have vengeance    after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman   he goes looking for his enemy    on his quest   he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government    the royal musketeers have lost their gusto   what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal s own guards    only a few loyal swashbuckers remain   among them athos and portos   who are only figureheads in this movie      together with d artagnan   they fight to extricate the queen   catherine deneuve   from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant    oh   and as an afterthought   d artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn   mena suvari      just thought i d mention that    now   look   i don t know whose idea this was   but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue lashing    i have nothing against   modernizing   classic works of literature   at the very least   they can inspire viewers to actually read the book   but films as dull as this have no positive side effects    director peter hyams   known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days   has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas  masterwork   the sense of excitement   cause   and camaraderie    instead   we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous   uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing    when the musketeers finally get to holler   all for one   and one for all     i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt    maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams s tone   which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader s digest condensed version of the story that he gives us    it s as though anything that may have been construed as   fun   was purposely expunged from the production    the joylessness of the proceedings   from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes   can be felt in every frame    chambers can t act   suvari   roth and deneuve can   but aren t given the chance    and when push comes to shove   the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious   though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit    some movies seem sloppy and careless   clearly made for a quick buck    with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful    the film is intricate   stylish and precise   hitting the wrong note every single time    
1320	1	only a year after the initial release of   scream     the horror send up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre   the inevitable sequel   scream 2   has arrived in our theaters    while the tongue in cheek   parodic element is still noticeable in this film   it s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story    the first film   while often violent and gruesome   was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant    the premise of   scream 2   is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called   stab     based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers   courtney cox   about the events in   scream     is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening    i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy    its conclusion   in which a bleeding   wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it s a publicity stunt   is more surreal and disturbing than anything else    the satire in   scream 2   thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general    although resident horror film geek randy   jamie kennedy   is back with fresh dialogue about sequels   and   interestingly enough   how they are usually inferior to their predecessors     the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well    everything from   friends   and   saved by the bell   to   showgirls   and   terminator 2   is referenced here   horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning   and there aren t any   wes carpenter   jokes this time    more importantly   this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film    the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from   scream     in fact   the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense     weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety   and one man seems willing to save the heroine s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show    understandably     scream 2   does not go so far as to actually blame the movies   but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted    couple that with the fact that several of the characters   most notably the lead character sidney prescott   neve campbell     are fairly well developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine chilling suspense   and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right    we don t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore   we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered   and   in one case   a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust   and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner    while i have not seen any of his other work   it s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated   slasher film   director   as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing    unfortunately     scream 2   occasionally reverts to the time honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window    for example   several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later   there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick   but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion    there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that   s   he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction    as for the question of whether or not   scream 2   is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor            well   it s hard to say    i gave the first   scream   3 1 2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light hearted send up       scream 2   bounces all over the place stylistically   but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment    i m not sure which is the better movie   but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing   sequels   however much randy might argue   do not necessarily suck    
1629	1	i have a soft spot in my heart for pure   amoral sleaze    i liked showgirls   there   i said it      i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz   sex filled cinematic tabloid ish trash    wild things is the best sleazy film i ve ever seen    it s filled with great performances   graphic sex   three way sex   rape charges   double crosses   plot twists   genitalia of all genders   graphic violence   death   witty humor   and   best of all   denise richards    criticizing this film for being disgusting   raucous   and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing   or titanic for being lofty and epic    wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors   but i don t just admire it for this  i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies    i must admit up front   however   that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal    i imagine that this shows    it s hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn t be known    i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer   but i was wrong   there are a lot of turns here    i ll just say that the film takes place in blue bay   a rich little town in florida    in blue bay lives sam lombardo   matt dillon     a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students   kelly van ryan   denise richards     and suzie toller   neve campbell      kelly s mother   sandra   theresa russell     immediately presses charges    all of this happens fairly early in the film    and right up until this point   i had the whole film predicted    i was wrong   though   and every time i was proven wrong   i was shocked    wild things isn t even remotely plausible   but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless   and often invited   just for kicks    i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers    i d give the preview four stars    it made me want to see the movie so much that i ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since    over the past few weeks though   i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview   see independence day     thankfully   i was proven wrong    the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company   not only does it make us want to see the film   but it doesn t give away any of the secrets    but i m not here to talk about the preview    i m here to talk about denise richards    now   i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers   but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she s in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can    of course   this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes       and  flawless body       but  i thought she did a great job acting   too   stop laughing      no   richards is truly a find  she is talented   and always convincing in this film    this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future    the other actors are good   too    dillon is as suave as ever   it s nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in   out      bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer    neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them   though i won t pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex    for a plot like this to work   all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived    that s okay   because director john mcnaughton knows that he s making a self consciously wicked film    each scene  even the three way sex scene  is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton   and the result is a sleaze fest that s too smart to resist    there isn t an inconsistent moment in wild things   every bit of it is alluring garbage   so trashy it s funny   and so entertaining it s painful    i loved it    
1445	1	 lake placid  is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie   ok so maybe it is   but this one is enjoyable   and clever    actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film    well the ending is kinda scary   but in most horror comedies they are    i will admit that  lake placid  isn t an oscar worthy film   but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny    bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating   is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth   after a man is bit in half    she gets there but really doesn t understand why she is there    bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened   along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man   they go out and find what is going on    what they find though isn t great    a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid   over 150 years old   he has migrated here for who knows why    they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from    betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid   and well you ll have to see the movie to find out    her character is very funny and foul mouthed   which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad   but funny    to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws    with the opening sequence   and some others   it is not original and is    when you watch this movie   you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it    david e   kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal   writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job    the characters have smartmouths   two foul   and some great one liners    but believe me   don t take  lake placid  too seriously or you won t like it    but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun  popcorn  type movie    but i guess it rates above the  popcorn  rating    sit back   watch the movie   laugh   scream   and whatever you want    even though the movie is r   and i put violence and gore    there s really not that much gore   but what there is might seem kinda gross to some     lake placid  is a smart   clever   funny   and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too    
1777	1	in these days of overlong movies   meet joe black   the thin red line   the mask of zorro   it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can t be longer than a paltry 90 minutes    this is just a cute movie   even through its mildly risque subject matter    old friends jackie   bannen   and michael   kelley   try to find the lottery winner   they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60   so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings    through process of elimination   they find that it must be lovable old ned devine   who they find sitting in front of his tv   clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand    what results is thuroughly amusing   as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong   and that they could really benefit    after all   old ned won t miss it    rather than divulge the later twists and turns   i ll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage    bannen and kelly are a perfect pair    one slightly stout   the other as thin as a rail    both getting on in years   they make such a cute pair of old codgers    waking ned devine may even be seen as a   full monty   for the geriatric set   especially since kelly gets buff o for one amusing scene    waking ned devine is by no means perfect   but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films    the performances by everyone in the town are great   particularly the two leads    there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary   but it hardly ruins the picture    writer director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters    scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm   not the exception    perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more    had i held off on my year s best worst list for another day   waking ned devine   officially released in late november of 98   surely would have graced the short group of the year s finest films    it is light   but thought provoking and sweet    i can t think of anyone who shouldn t see   or wouldn t enjoy   this film

274	0	i m a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson s work    he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain    with teaching mrs   tingle   his directorial debut   williamson has reached the end of his rope    what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here    the components are all there   including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to    but where are the thrills    the laughs    both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge    and what a shame that is    i loved the scream films   heck   i even enjoyed the sci fi goofiness of the faculty    kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office    teaching mrs   tingle   a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers   may put an end to his reign    or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties    i still have my faith   but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past    the title character of his pet project is a vicious   uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over the top by british actress helen mirren    mrs   tingle is basically every student s worst nightmare   a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard working of her pupils    the principal   michael mckean   is horrified of her   and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members    i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way    mirren s performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink    in other words   it s a poor substitute for williamson s best work    the plot is a big problem here    material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director    the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann   an over achiever hoping to get a college scholarship    but typical mrs   tingle says her history project   which she worked on for countless hours   is laughable    later on while studying in the gymnasium   a classmate   barry watson   offers her a photo copied duplicate of mrs   tingle s final exam    leigh ann s best friend   marisa coughlan   encourages her to use it    alas   the old hag herself finds the three scheming   and snatches the test   and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning    in the morning        how convenient    the three students head to mrs   tingle s house   attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann s name    things get out of hand   and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle    the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her    of course   not everything goes entirely to plan    besides pointless sub plots involving the football coach   jeffrey tambor   horribly wasted     there is little by way of actual progress    there is no urgency to the situation   little tension or laughs are involved    the humor is completely inconsistent    after many of the jokes   the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze    you continue to await some momentum in the story   something that could possibly revive the slow pace    a moment like that never arises    williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players   including the talented mckean and larry sanders  vet tambor    and the beautiful vivica a   fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor   and then williamson disposes of her character entirely    on the plus side   holmes and coughlan are admirable   with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression     and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher    while everything is pretty lifeless   teaching mrs   tingle remains watchable    there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again   but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script    mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching    she is convincingly evil and fun to watch   but even her gifted delivery can t save individual scenes that flounder in boredom    if there is one word for the movie surrounding her   it would be  disappointing     basically   kevin williamson is his worst enemy here    his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated   not that his writing here is especially good      we will see   when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas   whether williamson is for real    
861	0	in 1989   director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama     glory     but since then   he has made continuous disappointments   to me at least   with 1994 s   legends of the fall     and 1996 s   courage under fire      those two films weren t bad   just not very good   but with zwick s latest film     the siege     he has finally made one       the siege     is a modern day action thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city    investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard   denzel washington   and frank haddad   tony shalhoub     who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it    later   a bomb goes off in a broadway theater   killing even more    they soon meet cia operative elise kraft   annette bening     who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist    there are some movies that simply don t need to be made   and     the siege   may very well be one of them    oh   sure   zwick thinks he is making a   meaningful   action film   since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism   but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than   say     die hard     which also starred bruce willis    this time   willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u   s   army   who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax    whatever points     the siege     earnestly tried to make   were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen   or maybe   zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place    the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical   just as women were in the recent     john caprenter s vampires     by placing them all in the category of   bad guys         the siege     contains three fine actors   washington   bening   and shalhoub   but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development    bening has slightly more to do   and has an intriguing character to work with   while shalhoub pretty much steals the show   even though   again   he has no real character    by the climax of     the siege     with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so called   message   of the story   i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to     on deadly ground     in which steven seagal gave a 10 minute speech at the end about preserving the environment       the siege   is constantly heavy handed   not entertaining or insightful   and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay

1647	1	some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing   that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies    that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find   to their big surprise   that the majority of people vote republican   go to church every sunday and usually don t tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film    such rude awakening   however   can happen in another direction   conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in    something like that happens to jake van dorn   george c   scott     successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community    one day his daughter kristen   ilah davis   disappears from calvinist youth convention in california    van dorn is worried because he doesn t believe that his daughter would run from home    however   the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast   peter boyle   is even harder   kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film    infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast s investigation is going   so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself    unfortunately   he lacks experience and the quest   that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld   is fruitless    things change when he devises cunning plan and   while doing it   stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky   season hubley      almost two decades after its release   hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars    it is a real shame   because very few movies in today s hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt    in late 1970s   it was totally different situation   films were expected to have mature   serious themes for the mature audience    for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work   taxi driver   one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s    on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great    but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and   instead of facing them   prefers to live in rural   conservative cocoons    the new america   on the other hand   fares no better   ideals of the so called   sexual revolution     same as all other   revolutions   of the swinging sixties   degraded into exploitation and depravity    instead of being   liberated     baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms    schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas   actually   aren t so far away   nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn   already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist   meets sleazy porno producer   the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian   paternalistic and very dedicated to this job    the difference between the two is simply in the line of work    many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda    on the surface   it may look that way   audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest    in the first scenes   he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn t deserve to experience parent s worst nightmare    the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen s fate is extremely cruel   pain and humiliation   brought by oscar winning actor george c   scott   is of such intensity   that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda    van dorn is perhaps flawed   and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end   but the viewers simply know that his cause is just   and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body    on the other hand   schrader   who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn s   his own parents wouldn t allow him to watch movies until he was 18     knows better and tries to bring another side of coin    even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities   like nicky   who actually tries to improve her life   and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end    unfortunately   schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning   and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich   d finale    the script is slightly flawed   and schrader as director doesn t show too much originality   his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver    apart from the scenes in grand rapids   those two films even look alike    but the content might be more than interesting for today s viewer   especially those inspired by the current 70s revival    until boogie nights   no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s    hardcore   on the other hand   might serve as precious document   because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs   before the advent of video   when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists    the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering   though   but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience   that shouldn t be too surprising    anyway   despite some flaws   hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema    
663	0	i have a confession    even though i am a movie junkie i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies i ve never seen any of the original godzillas       note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u   s   godzilla released in 1998   it s the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni sen mireniamu      so   part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000 the latest entry in an almost 50 year old franchise    this was a long awaited treat    i was expecting a goofy good time   complete with bad dubbing   science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line    the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so   boring    i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt    you do get all of the   so bad they re good   traits so normally associated with the franchise    but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot    it s a deal i wasn t willing to accept    hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura s script crams in way too many details   and in many cases   fails to follow up on them    the maneuver is not only disconcerting   but gives the movie a permanent logy   weighty feel    godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops    was it a whim    a bold political statement    i don t know    its foe   an ancient meteor that looks like prudential s logo   doesn t just fight the beast from the far east    no   it s got to have life saving powers   a plot to erase   the data   from japan   a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature    there s a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit   takehiro murata   and a slimy government official   hiroshi abe   over the handling of godzilla   and personal issues    and then there s the plucky news photographer and blah   blah   blah    it s like watching magnolia all over again except without the good writing   keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs    what a waste    when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you   godzilla 2000 does the job it s entertaining and goes down easy    the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish    the dubbing is nice and awful   with murata sounding like he s in constant need of a cough drop    as for the dialogue   one line summarizes the goofiness factor     did anyone see that flying rock go by      this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that i ve heard the word   imbecile   used in casual conversation    though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments   i wouldn t take kids to see it    they ll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose    
1880	1	   i know what you did last summer     the first high profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996 s   scream     and written by the same screenwriter   kevin williamson   is a stylish   effective horror film that became 1997 s biggest hit of the fall season    while   scream   was a more knowing film about the genre     i know what you did last summer   is more reminiscent of a straight forward slasher flick   but it is far more intelligent than such bottom of the barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the   friday the 13th   films   well   okay     jason goes to hell   was pure hell to sit through      the film starts off with four talented   aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport   n   c    it is the 4th of july   and they will soon be heading their separate ways    kind hearted julie   jennifer love hewitt     and outsider ray   freddie prinze jr     will be headed off to college   while helen   sarah michelle gellar     who has just been honored croaker queen in the town   and her ignorant jock boyfriend   barry   ryan phillippe     are going to new york to become an actress and football player    when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain side beach for the evening   they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home    distraught and confused   they decide they can t go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter   so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean   in hopes no one will find him    julie is apprehensive about it   but is forced into it by barry    switch to exactly a year later   julie   still unable to come to terms with what she did   reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out    almost immediately   julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads     i know what you did last summer     and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook       i know what you did last summer     is a successful horror film for a number of reasons    the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian   as it put shadows   fog   steam   and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings    the characters   particularly julie and helen   are realistically written   and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes   which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort    and last   the film creates a few dazzling and scary set pieces that are some of the most memorable i ve seen in a horror movie   particularly the suspenseful   superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family s store with the killer inside with her    perhaps the best character is that of missy egan   anne heche     a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit    heche s performance is a standout   as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time       i know what you did last summer     could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems    prinze jr   gives a performance to be desired here   and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth    also   the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer   who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines    luckily   the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale   which includes an expertly crafted   jump in your seat   scare    in the main roles   hewitt and gellar are highly talented   and hewitt   especially   is one of the best screamers i ve ever heard    she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best   scream queen      and gellar is touching as a young woman who   in the course of one year   finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered    although not up to the level of either   scream   movies   or the more recent     urban legend       i know what you did last summer   is a respectable   smartly scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made    
55	0	one of the responses those that enjoy   detroit rock city     probably kiss fans   mostly   might have upon first glance at the rating i ve given the film might be something like     oh   that casey s gone and become a jaded critic on us    just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n  roll movie like this      i m wondering the same thing    i feel like i should have had a grand time with   detroit rock city      it s the sort of movie i wish i could ve had a lot of fun with   but i didn t    i just didn t    surely this film isn t trying to win any major awards   so should i have expected an oscar caliber film    no   but i expected something    a funny joke    a clever prank    a plot development    anything    the movie never delivers    you ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing       detroit rock city   is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film s existence   and it s not a very satisfying realization    the film is about four teenage boys   all huge kiss fans from cleveland   trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit   michigan    that s it    there is no big plot description in this review   because the movie has very little plot    the characters are hawk   edward furlong     lex   giuseppe andrews     trip   james debello     and jam   sam huntington      they have a garage band    they re pathetic   like all garage bands   but they like kiss and they like rock n  roll   so i guess that means we root for them    they have tickets   they lose them    they get more tickets   they lose those too    they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets   most of which backfire    there s not much more to it    frankly   it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film   when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys  hands   only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity    oh   and jam   real name jeremiah   has a really   really annoying ultra religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency    she doesn t want them to see kiss   if you hadn t figured that out already    it s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this    we ve got plenty of kiss   along with some ac dc   ramones   and thin lizzy    then again     maximum overdrive   had an awesome soundtrack   me being the big ac dc fan that i am     but is probably one of the worst movies of all time       detroit rock city   doesn t quite reach that level of ineptitude   but it gets dangerously close    in fact   the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind    basically   the soundtrack has earned the film a full half star   which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back   except for marilyn manson   whose half hearted cover of ac dc s   highway to hell   sounds like something my neighbor s cat coughed up      it s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste   because it  s evident that they re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie    edward furlong has done far better work than this   and so has natasha lyonne   and so has lin shaye   but hey   they ve got to make a living in hollywood    people wanting to see kiss   and lots of it will probably be disappointed   considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song    too bad   they might have provided some energy to this mess    director adam rifkin knows he hasn t got much material to work with   so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning    we get an endless parade of quick cuts   split screens   zoom outs   zoom ins   and rotating cameras   all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script    it s fun for a while   but eventually it becomes disorienting    i would recommend that those who felt seasick at   the blair witch project   stay far away from   detroit rock city     because the witch has got nothing on this baby    i haven t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since   armageddon      and what about that script    it s written by carl j   dupr     which sounds like as made up a name as i ve ever heard    if it is   i can t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible    a plotless   pointless rock n  roll movie can be fun   if the jokes and gags are actually funny    the jokes in   detroit rock city   rarely are    in fact   the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana laced pizza   and that was just because it was so surreal    the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it   comedy      there is no set up   just a succession of punchlines that don t provide for much in the way of chuckles   precisely because there was no set up    it s as if they just whacked someone on the head   pointed at him and said     see    funny      look   that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink    see    funny    look   that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver    twice    see    funny    look   that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money    see    funny    a word of advice to mr   dupr     no   these things aren t funny all by themselves    they must be preceded by a clever set up so the audience hasn  t predicted them five minutes in advance    that s it   i ve said enough about this movie    it s a waste of time and money    i liked the music   but don t bother buying the soundtrack    i hear it  s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie    you want to see this concept executed well    go rent roger corman s 1979 classic   rock n  roll high school      it features another late seventies rock band   the ramones   and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show    yes   go rent that   and skip   detroit rock city     which will probably bomb   and deservedly so

1865	1	not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets   lies    like bergman   director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters  inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations    also like bergman   leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters  ravished and wracked faces    and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film    all that is missing is a discussion of god    which is not to say that secrets   lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master    in fact   it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind    nonetheless   what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience    even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place    that it takes some effort to adjust to the film s rhythms    once the adjustment is made   however   there are great rewards    one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is    though leigh may have adopted some of bergman s stylistic touches   most obviously in an early scene of terse cross cutting during a married couple s strained conversation   as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score   the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any   style   at all    whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality   leigh makes the camera a mere observer   almost as in a pbs documentary    the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors    it is a tribute to everyone involved that   despite such scrutiny   only infrequently are we aware that anyone   is   acting    much has been made of brenda blethyn s performance   and rightly so   but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is    there are a few missteps    for one   except for one scene   tragicomic   as it happens     there is scant humor in the film    this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout    and occasionally   as with bergman   the bluntness of the situations can seem forced    for all that   this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention    it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets   lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite   for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film    in fact   it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it    there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film s unspoken take on race relations   something an american audience at least would do well to observe    nonetheless   secrets   lies is not for the faint of heart    though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish   the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen    needless to say   it is also very depressing at times    but for many of us   of course   so is life    and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending   that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better

1277	1	after the press screening of   moulin rouge     i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues    everyone seemed a bit numb   understandable after sitting through a barrage of often incongruous sounds and images    a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it    another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production   while a woman who flat out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye    when one fellow quietly stated   i ve never really been a fan of musicals     the statement surprised me because   even though the story is told almost completely through song   i didn t think of it as a musical    there is so much going on in   moulin rouge   that   musical   seems too small a term to cover it       moulin rouge   is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o  adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience    australian director baz luhrmann   the man behind   strictly ballroom   and   romeo   juliet     fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork   opulent imagery and songs ranging from   the sound of music   to   smells like teen spirit      sumptuous and beautiful   vulgar and overdone     moulin rogue   travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the   random   setting    oh   and it has a story as well       it was 1899   the summer of love           christian   ewan mcgregor   is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris     to write about truth   beauty   freedom and love     where he encounters a group of bohemians   led by henri de toulouse lautrec   john leguizamo      christian meets satine   nicole kidman     a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue   and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor    at once fragile and vivacious   the dazzling red haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying    christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well   which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession    working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler   jim broadbent     christian writes an opus modestly named   spectacular spectacular      zidler quickly finds a backer   the wealthy duke of monroth   richard roxburgh     but there s a catch   the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine    as if all that isn t enough   satine has a cough   and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold   it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land    like a teeter totter     moulin rogue   moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime    one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night   becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales    together they dance   while serenaded by the man in the moon   alessandro safina provides the vocals     apparently transported from the classic georges m   li   s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky    other scenes merely traffic in everything and the kitchen sink overload    the cavorting of toulouse lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy   accompanied by cartoon sound effects   is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like   bewitched   beat into the ground    of course   sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind       we never heard from baz to turn it down     one of the actors told the los angeles times       it was always    more    more        the director even sent a note to his cast reading     i dare you to make me say you ve gone too far      the musical numbers reflect his attitude    one knockout piece   the   elephant love medley     incorporates the beatles    all you need is love     u2 s   in the name of love     dolly parton s   i will always love you   and elton john and bernie taupin s   your song      need more    how about   diamonds are a girl s best friend   spiced with portions of   material girl      luhrmann s cast offers a wide variety of approaches that   together   add up to something messy   but often wonderful    ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian   emphasizing the sincerity of the love struck poet    mcgregor s singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments    once labeled the   ice queen     nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling   yet tender   performance    she handles the songs adroitly   although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range    veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler   wait until you see him perform   like a virgin      as the buffoonish duke   richard roxburgh proves to be the film s weakest link   although i m sure he was simply following instructions    i suspect   moulin rogue   will be one of those love it or hate it films    while i didn t completely love it   i most certainly liked it a lot    over the course of a year   i see well over 300 movies   and most of them look like xeroxes of each other       moulin rogue   is an original   and an original   even a flawed one   is a thing to be cherished    
1081	1	no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan s harrowing   humorous   horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe s novel about young lad francie brady s   eamonn owens   descent into madness in 1960s ireland    on one hand   it was difficult for me to become invested in francie s story because he is such an unsavory character   unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs   nugent   fiona shaw      on another hand   i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick   needy child   having been raised by a drunken father   stephen rea   and a suicidal mother   aisling o sullivan      on yet another hand   i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his   for lack of a better word     bad   deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them    however   the butcher boy s power is undeniable   and the film as a whole is unforgettable  perhaps because it is so disturbing    what makes it so unsettling is the francie s overall wink wink yet matter of fact attitude about everything   expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie   rea again      think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs   and you ll sort of understand    anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens   love francie or hate him   you cannot take your eyes off of owens    the butcher boy truly is a twisted   unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable    in the lobby after the screening   i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was   i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust     that movie was so unfunny         i didn t know what to expect    it s like something you chase for so long   but then you don t know how to react when you get it    i still don t know how to react        michael jordan   on winning his first nba championship in 1991       or    my thoughts after meeting him on november 21   1997  
1248	1	   the tailor of panama   is a different kind of spy movie    despite the presence of pierce brosnan   there is nary a hint of james bond flash here    instead of big action scenes   leering super villains and empty headed femme fatales   we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation    based on the novel by john le carr     who also co wrote the screenplay   the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year   a solid   well told story    brosnan plays andy osnard   a british operative walking on thin ice    his british superiors ship him off to panama   making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement    osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co workers and his new home base    when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that   since the creation of the panama canal   the structure is the sole connection between north and south america   he barely keeps from yawning    brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007   investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end    searching for a way to get information on the government   osnard sets his sights on harry pendel   geoffrey rush     an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite    harry claims to be a transplant from britain s renowned saville row   but osnard knows his secret   the tailor is an ex con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle s shop in an insurance scam    he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt   having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm    osnard offers harry a way out    he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele    eager to comply   harry offers what he knows   then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing    before long   he is forced to spy on his loving wife   louisa   jamie lee curtis     an aide to the canal director    harry s little lies build   eventually taking on a life of their own    osnard turns in reports about the   silent opposition     a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal    the bogus revelation proves explosive   leading to meetings in washington d   c   over how to best protect the vital waterway    meanwhile   osnard wallows in his newfound status   enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co worker    and harry grows ever more fretful   fearing the consequences if his clients   not to mention his wife   learn about his lies    geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry   fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings   all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor    rush makes harry a credible figure   presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity    after gaining fame playing larger than life characters   rush flips everything around for this role   using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems    although she gets far too little screen time   jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her    of the central characters   she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self confidence    curtis is one of my favorite female actors   whiplash smart   sultry and charismatic   she deserves more than supporting roles    speaking of supporting characters   there are some great ones here    harold pinter is amusing as harry s uncle benny   who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways    also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker   who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr   strangelove school of armed patriotism    but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson   both outstanding as two wounded activists    their presence adds weight to the story   reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men   there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal    director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location    instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop   he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there    the metropolis   described by one character as   casablanca without heroes   pulsates with life   underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people       the tailor of panama   succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment    
1954	1	director dominic sena   who made the highly underrated kalifornia   and producer jerry bruckheimer   the rock   armageddon   bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen    nicolas cage plays memphis   a retired car thief who s   pulled back in   to the business by an evil car thief overlord   christopher eccleston   determined to kill memphis  kid brother   giovanni ribisi      memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise   all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang    memphis sets out to put his old crew back together   but discovers that most of them have retired as well    gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits    in that sequence   we get a rockin  little tune from moby   along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects    filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence   and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride    and what follows doesn t disappoint        cage turns in one of his good performances here   he can easily go either way        good or bad        i don t know how he does that     and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely    of the supporting cast members   angelina jolie as memphis  former love is in the film just to provide eye candy   she s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i ve ever seen   and robert duvall as memphis  former mentor is just around to lend the film some class    also   i m a big fan of will patton   armageddon   the postman   and would love to see him get a huge role someday    none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately    some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles    delroy lindo   get shorty   shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis   as does timothy olyphant   go   as lindo s partner    i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important    the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion        mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll    there s no doubt in anyone s mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen   and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the   rival car thief   plot line    as it stands   that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package    but if i was making this film   i d have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew   thereby making memphis have to improvise        thereby adding some meat to the plot    the finale is essentially just a big car chase   and there just aren t ways to make car chases interesting anymore    it s all been done    the chase is also shot and edited in that   jerry bruckheimer action sequence   kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene    sure it s a car chase   but what exactly are the particulars of it    it s very hard to tell    finally   there s a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the   bus jumping the ramp   sequence from speed in the   oh   i don t think so          department    despite those minor complaints   gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment    it s not thought provoking   but it s shiny   loud and fun        just what a summer flick should be     pg 13   
693	0	this is the movie that could single handedly bring   mystery science theater 3000   out of cancellation    it s one of those movies that s so bad it s absolutely hilarious   due in no small part to its big star   supermodel cindy crawford    if you only remember one thing about fair game   it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues    if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l   a     you ll change your mind when you see fair game    ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition    in a real casting coup   crawford plays a super intelligent lawyer   in a jogging bra   of course      we all know this is a stretch   the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day    nonetheless   someone out there thought she d make a good lawyer   but we re reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes    and for you horny teenage boys out there   you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark        come to think of it   that may have been a body double    cindy crawford isn t black   is she    like i said   crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her    billy baldwin   or is it stephen    alec    adam    kim basinger     is the police detective who has to save her life   time after time   chase after chase   explosion after explosion    there s absolutely nothing original about this movie    it s every cop show of the 70 s mixed with every action thriller of the 80 s and every technology  exploitation movie of the 90 s    three decades of crap all in one place   driven further into the ground by crawford s complete lack of acting talent    and it s all completely predictable    you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them   you know when the   sexual tension   will finally end up in them consummating the relationship   you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movie s going to suck from the first scene    the plot isn t really explained until the end    all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer    in the words of one of the villains     we even know what size pantyhose she wears         yeah   you and every 14 year old boy in america      he goes on to add     we know more about her than she does          that  i find very easy to believe      i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes   because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones     if it weren t for me   you d still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba        because   you see   fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting   but also some seriously bad dialogue    it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn t supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh    one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief    would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like   i m very interested in  hard ware   and other crap about playing with his joystick    i wouldn t   but not because i m a computer nerd    it s just not funny    crawford s only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords  body        or was it jack lord s body    i ll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie    the boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft    crawford says woodenly     that was my client s boat you just blew up    i m filing a lawsuit against you    you re in big trouble     or something to that effect   and baldwin replies smugly     what do i have to do to get out of it      they of course begin making out and the credits roll    i m not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how   if they d really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say     you think i could settle out of court      but i will tell you that   if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her   you quote the final line of the movie to that person     what do i have to do to get out of it      serving america for over 1 50th of a century    
1004	1	you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to    in order to make the film a success   all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars   have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits    no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it s body   it s basically a complete re shoot of the shop around the corner   only adding a few modern twists      essentially   it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking    it s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy   not to mention very manipulative    but oh   how enjoyable that manipulation is    but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does   because i absolutely hated the previous ryan hanks teaming   sleepless in seattle    it couldn t have been the directing   because both films were helmed by the same woman    i haven t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ve got mail   but then again   is that really important    if you like something so much   why even question it    again   the storyline is as cliched as they come    tom hanks plays joe fox   the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley   the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family run children s book shop called   in a nice homage   the shop around the corner    fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business    little do they know   they are already in love with each other over the internet   only neither party knows the other person s true identity    the rest of the story isn t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen    sure   there are some mildly interesting subplots   but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship    all of this   of course   leads up to the predictable climax    but as foreseeable as the ending is   it s so damn cute and well done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does    when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love   i was filled with such   for lack of a better word   happiness that for the first time all year   i actually left the theater smiling    
428	0	   deep rising   gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively   not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid like menace   but the unfolding story is artificial   silly and almost completely derivative of countless other   and   for the most part   better   films    while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures    take   for example   the schlocky mountain highs of last spring s   anaconda        deep rising   has no tongue to put in its cheek    folks   we re only a month into the new year   and already here s a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases    most of the action takes place on the argonautica   a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage   uh oh    if these people had seen   titanic     then maybe they d have known to stay home   when it s attacked by a giant   tentacled sea creature    the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian   famke janssen     argonautica owner canton   anthony heald   and a few other crew members    a mercenary team   lead by resourceful captain john finnegan   treat williams     board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby    but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood soaked   hungry and not very helpful    the main problem with   deep rising   is its overt familiarity   the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci fi horror films in recent memory    the concept is   leviathan   meets   titanic     with a dash of   speed 2   thrown in for good   or is that bad      measure    this monster is equal parts   20   000 leagues under the sea   and   the relic     knows how to open doors like the raptors from   jurassic park   and even gets to expel a half digested victim   a neat effect   admittedly   a la the giant snake in   anaconda      some of the attack sequences are straight out of   jaws   and   alien      a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of   alien resurrection      there s even a jet ski chase like   hard rain      and the list goes on    watching   deep rising    s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself   because none of them have well developed characters   nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy    williams is affable enough   but his finnegan just isn t believable    an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted   pretty famke janssen   best known as   goldeneye    s killer thighs   is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams   while kevin j   o connor   as finnegan s mechanic   provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast    djimon honsou   who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december s   amistad     pops up in a brief part    he needs to stay away from the water    the movie s final shot is a groaner   as is the 11th hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on ship saboteur    as if a cast deserving of their snack food fate isn t bad enough   when you taunt the monster   you re really asking for it       deep rising   is a slow   stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot    and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is   the closer we are to the end of the movie   rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn t out of the question    
802	0	there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of   scream queen   in the early  80s    two of them were halloween movies   but the other two    prom night and terror train    were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween    the same   god   i m scared   there s some guy in a mask coming after me   routine she did in john carpenter s classic   jamie lee copies here   with none of the urgency or suspense    terror train takes place on   where else     a train   charted by some pre med students finishing their first four years of higher education    most of them won t make it to med school   though   and it s obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains     i wish to hell they d put a radio on that train      the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone   even jamie lee    from the beginning   he s talking his head off   he tells one of his co workers   think on this    when s the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station      as if it makes any kind of sense   and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles    of course   the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body   which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it    i forgot to mention the prologue    it s a party three years earlier   with the same group of students    two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge   promising him he s going to get laid    they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in   noticing a form on the bed    she says     kiss me   kenny     and he kisses the body on the bed   which happens to be a cadaver         oh my god   they killed kenny    you bastards        it s a sick trick   and one jamie lee wasn t let in on    she still hasn t forgiven the guy as they board the terror train     you asshole   you can t have a good time without hurting somebody          the killing starts before the train even leaves the station    since it s new year s   everyone s wearing disguises   a convenient plot device we ve seen before     and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one s looking    at least one of the characters says it s a groucho mask   when the killer dons it and steps aboard   it looks like gene shalit who   by the way   would make a great killer in a slasher movie    speaking of weird looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene   one of terror train s most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield   as the magician     who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music    then there s his greatest trick    getting laid with hair that looks like that    for all its attempts at visual style and substance   terror train is more lionel than amtrak   more prom night than halloween   and nothing really worth watching    only die hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield   if he truly has any fans   should even attempt to watch it    and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse    i mean   when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station   anyway    terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car    
1180	1	i don t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people   but it s something i used to wonder about when i was younger    i can t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat   but i m pretty sure andrew niccol   screenwriter for the truman show   has had the same curious thought    the truman show is about a man   jim carrey   whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public    since birth   he s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven   fla     which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign    all the people in truman burbank s life are actors   and the anonymous townfolk paid extras    people watch truman s life 24 hours a day   live   with no commercial interruptions    revenue comes instead from product placement   a staple of contemporary hollywood   with truman s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones    the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else    even if you haven t seen the truman show   you ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials   the trailer and other promotion blitzes    if anything i ve written so far is a surprise to you   then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news    either way   you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it   because otherwise you ll probably think it sucks    it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror   reciting the crucial   eat me   scene from alive   wishing his neighbors a good day   afternoon and evening   and living in domestic bliss with his wife   laura linney      but weird things start happening    a stage light comes falling out of the sky   truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father    we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child   sailing through a rainstorm    the death was staged by director christof   ed harris     who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island    similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth   not the least of them truman s best friend marlon   noah emmerich     who assures him he s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he d ever do is hurt him    as truman s trusting eyes tear over   christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else    there s even a daily behind the scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman s existence    the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama   because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions    and it all hinges on carrey   who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on    he s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura    most fundamentally   it s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person s life without the person realizing it    how they coordinate extras   hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors    the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this    sure   the most interesting tv genre of the  90s has been reality programming and jerry springer s popularity is through the roof   but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves    and when news shows use hidden cameras   it s done in the name of the greater good   not entertainment    but merge the two and you ve got the truman show    right now   it s implausible    i mean   the fcc won t let you say the s word on the air   do you think they d let you broadcast every detail of a man s life to the entire world without his consent    one day   though   it could happen    and   even though it would mean the end of privacy   people would eat it up    you know they would    
1500	1	this summer   one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham s series   a time to kill   was made into a major motion picture    on january 3 of this year   director rob reiner basically re released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi    based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars  assassination   ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25 year legal battle faced by myrlie evars   whoopi goldberg   sister act   and her quest to have her husband s obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith   james woods   casino   jailed    so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter   alec baldwin   heaven s prisoners   to imprison the former kkk member    ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african american history   from slave ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960 s    but all too soon   the white folks take over   intoning lines like   what s america got to do with anything    this is mississippi      as beckwith   james woods   with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man   teeters between portraying evil and its character    meanwhile   goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn t let her husband s death rest until she got the conviction    both deserve serious oscar consideration    this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin    let s face it   trying to match matthew mcconaughey s wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible    and baldwin is living proof of this   as no emotions could be felt    it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear    either poor acting or poor directing   but something definitely went wrong    another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg s facial features didn t change   as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband s dead body 25 years earlier    yet woods  was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg s father    at least the make up was realistic    with some emotional moments in the poorly written script   ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart   when its predecessor   a time to kill   brought tears to everyone s eyes    don t get me wrong   the movie wasn t all that bad   but if you ve seen grisham s masterpiece   then don t expect this one to be an excellent film        
1140	1	the second jackal based film to come out in 1997   the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal     this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland   and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo s own alma matter   concordia university in montreal   canada    the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal   but does not pretend to be 100  factual    plot   naval officer ramirez   quinn   gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal   in order to put an end to the actual militant s radical activities    he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee    ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this   assignment     and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism   intrigue and double personality syndrome   which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states      critique   great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two hour runtime    admittedly   i wasn t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film   and didn t expect much from this movie beforehand   but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments   as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line    the first hour is mostly just a build up of things to come   and does offer a great characterization of the jackal   but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending    quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal   but didn t offer anything extraordinary   in my opinion    sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they ve played in both of their respective careers of late   but nonetheless   appeared to relish the cold heartedness of their chosen characters    i didn t like performance put forth from quinn s wife in this flick   but then again   she doesn t show up in most of the film   so that wasn t so bad    i did however enjoy director duguay s interesting style and cinematic vision    this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences   but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer    i thought that was neat    having said that   i didn t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was   and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the   fake   jackal met with the   real   jackal s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part   but all in all   not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre    little known facts   ben kingsley s real name is krishna banji   he stands 5   8   was born in scarborough   england   and won the best actor honor in 1982 s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi    many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal   canada   joblo s haven of restfulness      donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland   is canadian   and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal    
1635	1	historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s    for many critics   scholars and   most importantly   film producers   it was a thing of the past   something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black and white television and non cgi special effects    but in 1995   same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago   there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor   producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre    and   same as in the case of dances with wolves   he was awarded for his effort with   oscars      the name of the film was braveheart   and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson    the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace   1272   1305      in his time   english king edward i   longshanks     played by patrick mcgoohan   has almost completely subdued entire british isles   including scotland   whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by   ius primae noctis   and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights    although english had killed his father many years ago   young scottish commoner william wallace   played by mel gibson   doesn t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron   played by catherine maccormack      murron s death changes that and wallace takes arms and   together with small but dedicated band of followers   begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country    through time   more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace s rag tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge    but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves   especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce   played by angus macfadyen     who wouldn t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader    braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson   so it wouldn t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann    however   even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre    the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism    while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale like vision of picturesque castles   splendid costumes and knights in shining armour   gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard   short and brutish    this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle   where hand to hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details   never seen since verhoeven s ultra naturalistic flesh   blood    compared with this naturalistic approach   most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays    braveheart also employs humour at the right places   not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences   but also to underline its down to earth atmosphere   so different from previous historical epics    what makes braveheart   larger than life   is his protagonist    mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and   as a result   character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero    wallace is more than superior to his enemies   both physically and mentally   yet he is able to show his sensitive   more vulnerable side    naturally   when the character is based on epic poems   most of historical accuracy is going down the drain   which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s      however   even those who don t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace   especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel   played by sophie marceau   and make her a child    because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended   and final scenes aren t as effective as they should be    mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful   and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors    most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan   whose cold   calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema    brendan gleeson   who would later become famous for his role in boorman s general   is also very good as wallace s trusted companion   as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy stricken king john balliol    david o harra is very entertaining as wallace s irish ally   and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience stricken character of robert the bruce    women in this film have rather thankless roles   especially marceau as one dimensional french princess    catherine mccormack as wallace s wife was more interesting   but she was eliminated from the picture early on    from the technical point of view   the film is also very good    photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen    on the other hand   the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern day instruments for period piece set in medieval times    although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike   braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism    the main reason for that was the fact that gibson   among many historical facts   chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of   longshank    s son prince edward   played by peter hanly      he is not only presented as a villain   but also as one of the less competent in villain s camp   and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in   politically correct   hollywood    to make things even more obvious   good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward   rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives  common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals    however   although the message of this film might look right wing   it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century    according to that ideology   oppressed classes   workers   peasants   are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and   as such   they are more radical   less willing to make compromises and more efficient   on the other hand   privileged classes   aristocracy   bourgeoisie   are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges    this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety    in the end   whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic   braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre    
1753	1	life is beautiful is a rare treat   a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful   or   even worse   humorless    it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce   stirs in a little poignancy   and ends up a very enjoyable movie    it s an italian film   but don t let that discourage you    subtitle phobes will be missing a wonderful experience    life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy   with the clownish   but good natured guido   roberto benigni   arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle    the year is 1939   and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams   dora   nicoletta braschi      their romance seems to be picture perfect   with only one stumbling block   she s already engaged to another man    can guido overcome the odds and win his girl    what do you think    however   five years later   things have taken a turn for the worse in italy    the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives   which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue   giorgio cantarini     who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp    unable to protect his boy in any other way   guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp    he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game   with points awarded for such tasks as hiding   being brave and being very very quiet    as you can tell from the description   life is beautiful has two very different tones   but manages to excel at both of them    as a romantic comedy   it is sweet and funny    as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair   it is touching    roberto benigni s work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin s   and it is easy to see why    he is able to run the gamut of comic expression   from slapstick to farce   with a warm hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero s   triumph of the underdog   spirit    life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust    however   it is able to successfully navigate the minefield   without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved   nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears    with life is beautiful   benigni has created a triumphant   but bittersweet comedy    it s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i ve had at the movies this year    
1245	1	although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama  the sopranos     analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it s own right    billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol   who new  patient  happens to be gangster boss paul vitti   de niro      ben wants nothing to do with vitti   as he s about to get married to laura macnamara   kudrow   and having a gangster as a patient wouldn t really help    but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds   and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out    all done in a comic fashion   of course    although never brilliant   analyze this is also never rubbish   which makes for a fun ride    billy crystal   who hasn t had a good role since city slickers way back in the early  90 s   is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act    he s pretty funny while he does it   and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers   he s pretty funny    robert de niro is hilarious as vitti   playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny    he s a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine    lisa kudrow   barely seen as crystals  estranged wife to be   basically reprises her phoebe role from t   v series friends   which is getting rather tiresome   and doesn t come off well on the screen    the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas   and are all funny caricatures   especially vitti s bodyguard jelly   joe viterelli      the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie   but with laughs instead of hard ass talking    it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film   but it strangely fits in    spoofs are made of famous gangster movies   including a nice parody of the godfather    the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun    there s also some odd plot points   fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason    it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history   and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script    unfortunately   this is hollywood   so we will never know    harold ramis   best known as egon from ghostbusters   has a deft touch with directing comedy   as shown in the immortal groundhog day   and the less immortal caddyshack    all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience    the script   written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan   starts off funny   remains funny for the most of the film   but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory    the film is short   however   and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll    analyze this is a good comedy   and is certainly worth watching    robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it   even though it does seem forced   or like a parody   although i think this was intentional      crystal is his most likeable in years   kudrow is given as little screen time as possible   which is a good thing   and de niro is just awesome    it s no goodfellas   and it probably won t be remembered as much as groundhog day   but analyze this is a well done comedy that won t leave you feel cheated    
1482	1	the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily    three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making    they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house    from there   things become a little more complicated    i can say   with absolute assurance   that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me    although i know it was all a staged   mockumentary     there s no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you    i didn t feel much upon initially watching it    i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts    i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend    i ve gotten chills every time i ve brought it up since then    this is not a movie that hits you right away    instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine   waits until you think everything is okay   then it slowly starts to creep it s way up into your mind    this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch    the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film   so don t expect any steadi cam shots or fancy camera work    this is as real as it gets folks    i don t recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though   because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera    the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real   you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not    this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing   especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera    the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape to film transfer done for the big screen    word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras   hours of deleted scenes   alternate endings   commentary   the sci fi channel special   and others   is being planned for release    i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd s    i know i ll be first in line to buy one     r   
1673	1	along his carreer   mel gibson has collected several successes   not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view    for all that   i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart    the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace   a popular scotch hero of the 13th century   where he would also perform the principal role    accepting so huge challenge   mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years   with a suppoosed failure   just to see recognized   by everyone   all his potentialities and   that way   to consolidate his position in hollywood    it was   definitely   an enormous risk but i m sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face    braveheart is   in fact   a magnificent and magisterial film    for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative s rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest    the william wallace s story is the story of so many others brave liberty s defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value   along the centuries    seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression   william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i   king of england   in a war by the autonomy of scotland    as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up    his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone   including the princess isabelle of wales   wife of edward s son    however   william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought    braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty   nowadays    mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast    patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i   the king longshank    the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good    sophie marceau   as princess isabelle   has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart    i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen   as robert the bruce   and   of course   mel gibson   as william wallace    however   i think this time the mel gibson s work as director was much better than his work as actor    the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is    when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes   view by the camera of john toll   then we realize all the beauty of this film    braveheart is   in my opinion   one of the best movies of 1995    i ve heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean    for now   let s see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia    it won t be easy    it s gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson

732	0	how do you judge a film that is so bad   but intentionally so    in spiceworld   the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal   mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it    if that was their goal   they did a fantastic job    so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasn t really meant to be much better than this    honestly   i d rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades   so does that mean i graded it inaccurately    truth be known   i don t really think i can answer this question    to understand spiceworld   you have to understand the spice girls    unless you re very   very   young   or fairly older   you probably have at least heard of them    they re a group of five busty british babes who ve had  1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions    they re primarily adored by pre teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice s   real name   geri haliwell   wonderbra    all five of the girls have these   spicy   names for which they are better known than their real names    there is the aforementioned ginger spice   as well as sporty spice   melanie chisholm   or mel c       scary spice   melanie brown   or mel b       baby spice   emma bunton     and posh spice   victoria addams     and all of them   to some degree or another   resemble their stage names    the spice girls took the world by storm   and spiceworld is actually a good  humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame    it s quite nice to see what good sports the girls are   and not just the one dubbed sporty   about poking fun at themselves    they don t take themselves too seriously   and that s probably the best thing about them    it s also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera   acting     and not just singing and dancing    they re not flawless by any means   but for the most part   they deliver their lines without feeling staged   and   like them or not   we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters   which seems reasonable since they portray themselves      what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won t get enough of their music   while the rest of us don t get enough of a movie    the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes    most of the film is very blas     but several parts are downright boring   and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud    if you re a big fan of the group   you probably won t get enough of what you want   and if you re not a big fan   you get too much time devoted to nothing more than   look at us   moments    for the right crowd   the   music video   sequences will be the highlights of the film   but for others   they will serve as three minute lulls in a hectic but overall uneventful storyline    other key actors include richard e   grant as clifford   the spice girls  manager   alan cumming as the film maker piers cutherton smyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group   george wendt as martin barnfield   a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie   and roger moore in a small   self parodizing role    all provide relatively good performances   keeping in mind once again that this film wasn t meant to be acted seriously    even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it    while this film is continuously compared to the beatles  a hard day s night   i think that is an unjust comparison    it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits   but i don t think drector bob spiers   nor the spice girls   intended it to be so    i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film   and have instead   come off rather pretentious    i don t think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun   satirical look at a group that got so big   a movie seemed the next likely step    and what could ve been better than a self indulged yet self  mocking approach    probably nothing   and so it is    spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy   but now instead   i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didn t even give a good review    it s bad   but it succeeds in every way it intended    it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment    perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick    if that s the case   the movie s gimmick is that it   is   such a gimmick    you might be saying     a spice girls movie    come on       but when it comes down to it   i think that s the point    
617	0	i m going to start this review off with a hypothetical question    let s say you ve just been in a car accident   and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious    your friends have left to go get help   and you re waiting to see if the victim wakes up    a tow truck comes along   and the driver hops out of the truck to see what s going on    he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck    do you    a   run away screaming for your life   staying away from the main road    b   run away   but not too fast   and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you     stop   to catch your breath   try to negotiate with the psycho   and when that fails   start running away again   all the while   staying on the main road      if you answered   a     you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of   texas chainsaw massacre   the next generation   and will likely hate this movie    however   if you answered   b     prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind       texas chainsaw massacre   the next generation   is being called a sequel   but it s really more of a remake of the original    there s a few changes here and there   but it s essentially the same   even the infamous   meathook   scene has been re created      the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom   and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere    needless to say   they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family    much carnage ensues    to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly    in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question   there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere    it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel    no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he she is going around killing people with the planes wheel    the dialogue is even more atrocious    zellwegger   who is kidnapped by   the family   early on   keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people    when you re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses   i would think that rationality would go out the window    speaking of going out the window   there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window    apparently   the stunt double had a little trouble   because she visibly gets stuck in the window    the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double   doesn t   get caught in the window    this was one of many glaring inconsistencies    there are so many   in fact   that if i were to name them all   this review would be several pages long    the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey    he plays a member of   the family   with a hydraulic leg   home made   i might add   and is so completely over the top   you can t help but be amazed by his performance    he obviously had a lot of fun with this part   and it really shows    he makes jack nicholson s portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in   the shining   look restrained in comparison    for a horror movie     texas chainsaw massacre   the next generation   contains surprisingly little gore    in fact   in contains none    there s a little blood here and there   but that s as far as it goes    which leads me to believe that the budget must have been   astonishingly   low   and it shows    everything about the movie looks cheap   from the sets to the costumes    especially leatherface    once frightening and nightmare inducing   he s now as terrifying as dame edna    do yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake    check out the far superior original instead

1884	1	airplane   is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film making    after all   it s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing directing teams    even if most people don t recognize the names behind the films   they are bound to recognize the titles   airplane     top secret   the naked gun   and hot shots to name a few    but although the zucker abrahams zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977   airplane    remains the true cornerstone of their work   and their directorial debuts    in the seventies   disaster films seemed to be at an all time high    films like earthquake   the towering inferno   and the poseidon adventure were big hits    there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane   a series that spanned the entire decade    and so   in 1980   we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film    this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean            it had to do with bad fish    airplane   is the story of ted striker   robert hays     an ex fighter pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six   er   seven comrades    unable to stop living in the past   ted s world fell apart    he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job   and eventually   as we begin this film   is getting dumped by his lover   flight attendant elaine dickinson   julie hagerty      in a desperate attempt not to lose her   ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working    unfortunately   she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her   which leaves him wallowing in self pity    in the midst of it all   something happens    someone gets sick    then another    then another    soon   the whole plane is full of deathly ill chicago bound people            and when the pilots get sick   played by peter graves   kareem abdul jabbar   and frank ashmore     who will save the day       gee   i wonder    of course the main draw here is the non stop   whiz bang   comedy   with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags    although i had seen this movie a few times before   i was still laughing thru the entire thing    the most fun character by far is the doctor   played by leslie nielsen    he s a dry   subtle   sterotypically straight faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film    in a film like this   you re not really expecting an elaborate production   so one can t complain about the amateurish quality    what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny   played by stephen stucker    this character is pointless   nauseating   and very unfunny    i don t know why he was put in there   and i don t think anybody will find a good excuse    and when the film nears an end   it slows down quite a bit   almost getting old    you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long    aside from that   airplane    is really a top notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic    it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends   especially if they haven t seen it    and if they ask what the plot is   just tell  em   it s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film   but that s not important right now      if you ve seen the film   you ll understand

150	0	i have no real tangible proof of this   but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script   written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director   then it is actually possible to make a good movie    using their logic   all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget    this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time   not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre      now   before i continue to ferociously attack what s wrong with this film   i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller    catherine zeta jones plays virginia baker   an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal   sean connery      if you ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before   i really don t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details   the two team up for various jobs   stealing various things for various purposes    the problem we come to is that we ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn t break any new ground in the big budget hollywood action genre    the result is that the entire production feels contrived    i m going to be completely honest here   pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run time was looking at catherine zeta jones    now while this may be a compliment for ms   zeta jones   it certainly isn t for either the writers or the director   who are not nearly as clever as they think they are    just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between   entrapment   and   blackmail      with an eighty million dollar budget   you d think that entrapment would at least feature edge of your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f x    well   you d be wrong    the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular    unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment   die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by   11 years    the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture   you know exactly what s going to happen   despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists    many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta jones in extremely tight fitting clothing    one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask    nothing wrong with that   but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was   so why didn t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room    i ll tell you why   because it s a great excuse to photograph zeta jones  posterior as it slides underneath those beams   and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing   the rehearsal      ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie   and though he has great screen presence   although so do connery and zeta jones   and the most interesting character in the film   not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss   a concept i invented just to describe this picture      one last complaint   entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building   or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot   he ll spontaneously disappear in ninja like fashion    i can picture amiel patting himself on the back   thinking to himself   it ll leave the audience wondering for days   how did he do that      we know jon   it s called editing

1551	1	to me   nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film    despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed   the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence    ever since the big success of the action thriller  face off  in 1997   the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr   cage    the perpetually awful assassination thriller  snake eyes  was one of 1998 s worst films     8mm  was a disappointing lost cause    but who better than scorsese to match cage s wit and intensity   which he does in miraculous fashion with  bringing out the dead     cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce   a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day to day    after five years of the stress inducing job   frank basically just staggers onward   relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends    he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care   namely a young girl named rose   who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york    frank desperately wants to be fired   but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need    i ll fire you tomorrow         he promises      frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance    the first is larry   john goodman     who always has food on the brain    the second is marcus   ving rhames     a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation    and finally   tom   tom sizemore   is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood    i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank   but they never figured into the actual plot    each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank s character   because  bringing out the dead  is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality    the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary   patricia arquette     the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack    arquette   who recently received the wounds of christ in  stigmata    performs well around real life husband cage    it s unfortunate that   after such intriguing character trials and tribulations   the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled   ineffective finale    the movie belongs to the one two punch of cage and scorsese   who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to  bringing out the dead     although it certainly lacks the grit and hard edge of something like  goodfellas    scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture    the incredible camera work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration    fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive   darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997 s  kundun     does  bringing out the dead  rival scorsese s finest work    only occasionally    some of the film feels surprisingly limp   but there is enough energy in it s interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice    those expecting a grisly   risqu   product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight arrow approach   but it s still a solid   admirable effort     bringing out the dead  was written by the acclaimed paul schrader   who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as  taxi driver  and  raging bull     schrader s script is full of moments   wonderful   sharply defined moments   that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay    the exceptional aspects of the film are it s astounding technical credits and the amazing cast    goodman and sizemore are both electric   well   mainly sizemore     but it s the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look    watch the actor s deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member   and you ll understand why he won a golden globe     bringing out the dead  is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it s certain flaws    scorsese   and cage   for that matter   have done better   but their intentions are certainly admirable    
937	0	the plot of big momma s house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress    that s not just the high concept premise   it s the fully realized   all encompassing plot    such an emphasis is not unheard of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment    one need merely look back to last summer   when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent    the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high concept plot idea better be pretty well realized   or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer   because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time    not a developed character   not a provocative theme   not a witty twist    you will get 90 plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress    nothing more   nothing less    those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one note dud that is big momma s house    others will simply stare   mouth agape   at its sheer unapologetic laziness    lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner   an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john   paul giamatti      dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco   terrence howard   has escaped from prison   and the feds think he s headed for his former girlfriend and presumed but never proved accomplice sherry   nia long      sherry   however   has fled with her son trent   jascha washington     possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae   ella mitchell     better known as big momma    indeed   sherry appears to be on her way   but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming    that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows    big momma s house s bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs    doubtfire    director raja gosnell edited that film   and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom    but there s just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character s attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman    unfortunately   big momma s house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made   instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses   it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters    suspension of disbelief in big momma s house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and or stupid   since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other    of course   laughs trumps logic every time   and big momma s house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny    and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul tempered beast   while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry    unfortunately   no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another   very different real person   so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags   malcolm reacting violently to big momma s explosive diarrhea attack   malcolm as momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball   malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments   malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife   one of the few sequences that works      martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times   but there s no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character    he s just big momma without the makeup on    i won t waste time commenting on how ineptly the set up of the escaped convict is employed   since it was clearly a waste of time to the film makers    there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure   but he s ultimately a distraction in a film that s really about its central visual incongruity   and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long s posterior      i m never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people    several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing    but i know that when a film maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it s an entire film   i duck out of the way    the gross implausibility of big momma s house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big   cleverly constructed laughs    its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant    big momma s house is ridiculous  and  not funny    it s just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress    
1123	1	i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool    i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage   grousing to myself about its transparently planes   trains and automobiles plot machinations   and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement    this was a mass market romantic comedy   after all   a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and   even in its best days   worked hard to perpetuate the romance   infatuation paradigm    then marc lawrence did something wonderful   something which made the entire film click into place   he showed me a comic love story about grown ups    it certainly didn t look that way from the outset   which introduces groom to be ben holmes   ben affleck   at his bachelor party   surrounded by friends and family whooping over his   last night of freedom      ben loves his fiancee bridget   maura tierney     but the doom and gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this  till death do you part business    then   on an ill fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah   ben meets sarah lewis   sandra bullock     a free spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her    as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn   ben and sarah begin a three day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger   ben seeing in sarah the chances he s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she s never had    forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start   setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue    ben is an ideal role for affleck s easy going charm   and he plays the straight laced straight man without forced exasperation    sandra bullock   for her part   is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half dozen films combined   avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping    the two performances    part of a great top to bottom cast    are effective and connected from the start   yet the script s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely    lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis   forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self justification    the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose   leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution    forces of nature isn t about a man developing a fear of commitment   it s about a man learning what commitment means  to him    learning that it s not what he thought it was    lawrence s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending   an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense    earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance   and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine    though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film   and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples   forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom    that is   provided you re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes    for a brisk romantic comedy   forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over directed scenes of the year   teetering hand held shots   why not low or high angles   sweeping pans    occasionally the hyper real approach works   with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance   far more often   hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is   covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can t find what s underneath    a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director   but even hughes  excesses can t spoil this unique concoction    forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant   something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents    
1511	1	as i write the review for the new hanks ryan romantic comedy you ve got mail   i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet    i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world s biggest paid commercial for america online    and i wonder   is that so bad    well   the commercial part is    as for the movie   well   as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan   i think i ll be okay    to paraphrase james berardinelli   whose reviews i admire very much   tom hanks and meg ryan can act    they are both wonderful   but for all of hanks  glorious work in serious films   such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan   and his glorious triumph in philadelphia   i like him best when he s suitably obnoxious    tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he s going to get the girl   the only question is how    meg ryan   america s high school sweetheart   can act    she s had a handful of memorable performances   including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally   i must not mention what she does   due to the   well   um   you get the idea   and if you don t   get the movie   fantastic      but   i like her best when she s   well   perky    she is so adorably perky cute that together with hanks   they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime    some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples   but i don t really know    all i know is that i just like them both    they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that s really hard to resist   and i m not going to even try    they re just really   really cute   sweet   and charming    hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron   who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle    here   the setup is a little different    kathleen kelly   ryan   owns a small children s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her    she is successful   beautiful   and dates a well known columnist with very radical idea   kinnear      she is also having an affair   of sorts    you see   kathleen   with the handle shopgirl   is secretly emailing ny152    they have a strictly un detailed relationship   there are no specifics   and they have no idea who each other is    ny152 happens to be joe fox   hanks     a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega bookstores   run by his father   coleman      fox books has decided to open a store on the west side   right across from a little children s bookseller named   shop around the corner     run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly    every morning   these two email each other silly   and every day   they fight   to the death          it s a charming premise   and one that works nicely   balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have    it also has the great sense of being a classic romance   there is no   let s have sex tonight   mantra   if you ll excuse my bluntness    this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love    hmm   well   the movie goes through twists and turns   having some sad moments and happy ones   until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan   hook up     to use modern terminology   and kiss their way into happiness    you know it s going to happen   the question is now    thankfully   ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey   kinnear   chappelle   and a host of others   including a great scene involving brothers   aunts   and two sweet kids    it s all cute and wonderful   and for all of the idealism   it makes me feel good    hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is    he is   i believe   america s greatest actor    does he show it here    nah    but he s still tom hanks   and she s still meg ryan    which is what this movie boils down to    it s pure confection    all the bits about the godfather   the jokes   the superb script   it s all really sweet    there are some immense flaws   like pacing    the last third of the movie really doesn t work as well as i would have liked   and for a romantic comedy   it s slow    once hanks knows the secret   it gets really slow    i even looked at my watch a couple times   to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for   so that i could get home at a reasonable hour    the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated    e mail    when my kids are my age   i don t know what we ll be using    but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody   and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history    they just work together   and it s nice to see    it gives you   well   a smile    the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious   and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake    i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was    i ve always believed that movies are very powerful   very powerful indeed    you see   mankind has three abilities he needs to survive   the ability to think   entertain   and procreate    movies can definitely do the first two   and as for the third   well   i d rather not think about that    i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint   and that films that entertained you were good   because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night    and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had    hanks was the driving force behind one of the year s best films in saving private ryan   which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world    he s also half of the glue behind the year s best example of pure entertainment    tom hanks and

1580	1	for a movie about disco era excess     54   comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club    think of it as a sort of   boogie nights    lite   where that similarly structured and  set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift     54   leaves the kinkier details to your imagination    it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter   but it thankfully never resorts to preaching   either    in fact   were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment     54   would be about as feathery as the time period s popular female hairstyle    studio 54 was a haven for the rich   famous and generally good looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986    inside   anything went and   we are told   everything did    the film s fictional main character is shane o shea   ryan phillippe   the jerky jock from   i know what you did last summer       a fresh faced 19 year old who dreams of venturing beyond the club s velvet rope and coming face to face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines    his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell   mike myers   spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in  79 and permits him passage   but not before he doffs his hideous shirt   of course    once inside   shane becomes seduced by the club s dizzying vortex of sex and drugs    he has such a good time that he doesn t want to leave   so he seeks employment as a busboy    he quickly becomes friends with greg   breckin meyer   and anita   salma hayek     a married couple who work along side of him   greg s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender   while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own    after rubbing elbows   among other things   with a renowned socialite   sela ward   and gaining the personal interest of rubell   shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54    but fame doesn t come without a price       54    s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players   at a slim hour and a half   the film is too short to take on such a multi character focus   and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act    alleged last minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction   since   54   sometimes feels like it s missing a scene here or there    nowhere is this more apparent than in shane s relationship with soap opera actress julie black   neve campbell     a frequent studio 54 patron whom he s long admired from afar    the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special    that   54   works despite these limitations   then   is largely due to the competence and energy with which it s assembled    sure   it s shallow   slick   sanitized portrait of a bygone age   and sure   we ve seen the rags to riches story gazillions of times   but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision    the film boasts some fine comic creativity   the pinnacle of which is disco dottie     the wedding singer    s ellen dow     an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public   but slides up to shane behind 54 s closed doors and asks for a   funky little treat      the solid   sexy cast smooths out   if only while you re caught up in the film   any rough spots belonging to their alter egos or the plot    newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat   he and campbell   as fetching as ever   look so good together it s a shame their subplot goes nowhere    meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in   clueless     he was the stoner with the joker smile     while hayek simply sizzles   especially when leading a dance class with the mantra     one   two   three   attitude      sherry stringfield   unidentifiable under big  70s hair   takes on her first big screen gig since she left   er   as rubell s accountant   but she s criminally underused    as the droopy eyed   drug addled steve rubell   myers is worth the price of admission alone    when he s not playing the life of the party   the ex    saturday night live   comedian strips away all of rubell s confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty   unhappy life with exorbitance   it s a moment worthy of pity when   while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening   he attempts to seduce one of his employees    and while his performance is largely serious   myers mixes the empathy with a delicate   austin powers    esque wink   thus keeping consistent with   54    s overall feel   gaudy   larger than life and satisfyingly ornamental   not unlike a giant disco ball    
1713	1	in   the sweet hereafter     writer director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living    he shows us how it isn t dying that hurts   but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death   and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings    on a cold winter day in a small   isolated town in british columbia   a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake   where it cracks through the ice and sinks    fourteen children die   and numerous others are hurt    for the residents of this small town   all of whose children were on that bus   it is an earth shattering event that resolutely alters their lives    they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain   but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle    alberta and risa walker   who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident   hire an attorney named mitchell stephens   ian holm   to bring a lawsuit against someone   anyone for responsibility    the bus driver   dolores driscoll   gabrielle rose     is a kindly woman who loved the children and   although she lives with a burden of guilt   is not held responsible for the accident    the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice   and there was nothing should could do to prevent it    however   according to stephens   there are no   accidents   in life   and someone will pay for this tragedy   whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through    he goes through the town   approaching the parents who have lost children   asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger    and   for his work   stephens will receive one third of the settlement money    however   it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money    he is driven by something else   something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents    he has lost a child   too   but not in the same manner    his daughter   zoe   caerthan banks     who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite   has been in and out of drug re hab clinics and detox stations for ten years    she calls him on an irregular basis   begging him for money   but refusing to tell him what she needs it for       i don t know who i m taking to     he tells her    in his mind   his daughter is dead    the lawsuit is   to stephens   not only a way to mend the town s pain   but also his own    however   not everyone in town wants it to happen    billy ansell   bruce greenwood     who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children   wants nothing to do with it    he has already lost his wife   and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman    he doesn t want to talk about the accident   and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds    to him   the town should be able to take care of its own pain   and it doesn t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way    central to   the sweet hereafter   is the tale of nicole burnell   sarah polley     a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into   a wheelchair girl     as she puts it    aside from stephens   nicole is the most complex character in the film   and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out    it is also her sad   haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack   reading robert browning s poem about the pied piper   and how when he led all the town s children away   one was left behind because he was crippled    obviously   nicole is that child   and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town s children left her alone by dying in the wreck    her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving   but incestuous relationship with her father   tom mccamus      there is only one   fleeting scene that suggests this relationship   but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film    of all the storylines in   the sweet hereafter     this is the most complicated and unresolved   although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film    egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers    if any at all    and he doesn t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up    what egoyan has done in   the sweet hereafter   is really nothing short of miraculous    in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks   he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss   and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life    egoyan has always been a talented   but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold       the sweet hereafter   is quite the opposite   egoyan s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion   and draw the audience into the tragedy       the sweet hereafter   seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked    the film is filled with beautiful   subtle performances from all the actors   especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind    the beautiful   roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting   melodic musical score by mychael danna   both previous egoyan collaborators   give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements    like his earlier films   egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole    he works with time as a fluid substance   shifting back and forth between the past   the distant past   and the present with effortless ease    the actual bus wreck itself doesn t happen until midway through the film   but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail   and still have it carry great   devastating weight    because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies   it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple   direct terms    certainly one of the best films of 1997     the sweet hereafter   is a deeply rewarding   mystifying   and ultimately human film    
506	0	american pie 2 is filled with laughs    but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater    i m no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy    but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment   not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself    what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart    of the original   i noted it was   a warm   pleasant outing about the travails of growing up      well   the quartet of chums   jim   jason biggs     oz   chris klein     kevin   thomas ian nicholas   and finch   eddie kaye thomas     have grown up    at least they are a year older   but don t seem any wiser    fresh from their first year of college the quartet   along with the obnoxious stifler   seann william scott     rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score    as usual nothing goes right until the last reel    but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women    and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women    for the most part   they are not shown as individuals    they are nothing more than potential recipients of over active   raging hormones    it is telling that the most normal couple   oz and heather   mena suvari   spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex   she s overseas on an exchange student program    despite having been to college   jim is still klutzy and awkward   unsure of himself around the opposite sex    most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him   including a painful episode involving an instant glue like substance    also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates   whom the boys suspect of being lesbians    it is offensive and plays upon outdated   adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs    the first film   despite some raunchy moments   had an innocent charm to it    the sequel is more cynical    it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them   the many mentions of finch s encounter with stifler s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy s return as jim s well meaning   trying to be hip dad    the only performer who is actually given some new   fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle   the band geek from the original    in the sequel   she imbues her character with vulnerability   wisdom and maturity    american pie 2 is a pre sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office    it is a shame   though   that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz   who also penned the original   could not have set his sights higher    american pie 2 is funny   but it s still a comedown as well as a letdown

786	0	   varsity blues   is the best film of 1999 thus far    unfortunately   it is also the first film i have seen from 1999    it is another one of those small town sports movies that involves a flawed   but good heartedfrom 1999    it is another one of those small town sports movies that involves a flawed   but good hearted protagonist   a rough and meanspirited coach   and the   big game      by the end   will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph    will everyone in the town turn against the coach    will the team win the climactic game    do cats bathe themselves regularly    the so called   hero   in question is john moxin   james van der beek     a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team   but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead end town    at least he s got the right idea   since west canaan   texas is portrayed in the film as   frankly   pathetic   with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming    heck   in one scene   the front page of the town s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers  big win the night before    when the team s star quarterback is severely injured   tearing the ligaments in his leg   john finds himself taking over as the team s leader   but his few minutes of glory do not last long   as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend   amy smart   when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl   ali larter      and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint   all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics     the team loses their second to last game   putting john at feuds with the coach   jon voight who   like gary oldman   is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the   bad guy        worse yet   the coach is threatening to ruin john s scholarship chances if the badgers don t win their final game    the plotting of   varsity blues   is as old as the hills   and contains every cliche in the book    admittedly   i was never exactly bored while i was watching it   but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained    throughout   all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983 s   all the right moves      one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were   least of all certainly not john   who   played by van der beek   of tv s   dawson s creek       is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities    while i probably shouldn t blame this on van der beek   since the inauspicious and   by the numbers   screenplay by w   peter iliff isn t of any help   he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in   all the right moves      the story revolving around john   meanwhile   is extemely thin throughout   particularly for its 104 minute running time   and it alternates between uninspired comic relief   as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club   and heavy handed melodrama    the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot   but we also learned very little about her   which is unfortunate since amy smart   whom i don t think i ve seen before in past films   is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence    smart does not allow her character to become the   passive girlfriend     instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions    it s too bad the camera didn t linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts    the adult characters probably fare the worse of any   since they all must play residents of a dim witted town that cares about nothing but football    john s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance    his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university   but john doesn t want any part of that    his mother stands beside her   big   strong husband   and is a passive female    finally   jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one dimensional    saving   varsity blues   from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences   including one set in the sex education class   which did get a laugh out of me    the scenes of playing football were well shot and thankfully didn t overstay their welcome   as many sports films fall victim to    but leaving the theater   the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made    i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately   since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood    do we really need another high school sports film    no   we don t   and certainly not one of this low caliber   which felt like a cut and paste job of spare parts from

1442	1	an astonishingly difficult movie to watch   the last temptation of   christ may be scorsese s most important film   and yet his most   impossibly abstract as well    scorsese presents the life of jesus   christ   through nikos kazantzakis  novel   which details the life of   christ from approximately 20 until the day of crucifixtion    jesus of   nazareth   dafoe   is a carpenter   who opens the film making crosses   so   that he can escape the fate he is subjected to   his destiny on earth      yet   he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others     and subjects himself to a desert in exile   in hopes that he can reach   god    before leaving   he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene     barbara hershey     a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus       20  after going to the desert   christ learns his true purpose in life     and what he must do    aided by judas   keitel     he sets off on teaching   the world his message    along the way   he meets john the baptist   the   rest of the prophets   and tries to teach the world his message    christ   is also confronted by internal demons and self doubt   as he tries to   find his true purpose throughout the entire film    during the story     judas is the closese ally of jesus   his betrayal   argues the film   was   not out of hate   but out of love   in order to allow christ to die     20  he is eventually captured   and crucified as per the bibile      however   as he is about to die on the cross   he is saved by a girl   who   brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene    the girl is a guardian   angel who is from god   and who has saved him from his death    jesus goes   on to live a life as a man   as a carpenter   and does not die on the   cross    on his deathbed   in the final moments of his life   he is visited   by the prophets   and by judas   who denounces his master for   not keeping   his end of the bargain      judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil     and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act    jesus   escapes from his deathbed   and asks his father for forgiveness   for   succumbing to his last temptation    visually and aurally   the film is absolutely breathtaking    no other   director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of   christ s life to the screen    peter gabriel contributes a score than is   simply astonishing   with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer    the   performances are simply exquisite   with dafoe leading the way with a   mesmerizing turn as jesus    keitel   although his accent is a problem   is   passionately brilliant   fighting through language to bring the character   to life    the visuals are also amazing    scorsese frames his movie in a   harsh tone   leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is   having human frailties    the film   though   has many trouble spots    paul schrader s script is   one    schrader uses modern day new york english to tell the story   along   with new york words   new york mannerisms   and new york slang speech      the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ    there is   no underlying message behind the man s words    the film fails to capture   the glory and splendor of christ    had it faithfully explored that   aspect   than the dichotomy of jesus  soul   his frailties and doubt mixed   with his unmistakable glory   would have been simply spectacular    the   message of christ is confused between love and violence   and the film   merely tells us jesus is great   instead of showing us his greatness    the film is also overlong    it just drags in the middle   with   nothing truly happening    christ is a confused figure   in the sense that   the audience doesn t know who he really is    schrader forgets to give   jesus a message   to show that he truly is the messiah   to give him the   divinity    without that   he is a rambling prophet   who the audience   themselves do not believe    there are several moments of accidental   hilarity   and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach      there are moments of brief awe and power   followed by moments of   confused hilarity    that said   the controversial temptation sequence is something to   behold    it is a step in an unexpected direction   one that leaves the   audience puzzled   until the arrival of the disciples    it is a simply   breathtaking scene   with jesus about to die as a mortal    it is truly   one of scorsese s finest moments    it is unfortunate that scorsese   couldn t make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene     20

616	0	   flubber   is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation   and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney    it s the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids   but anyone else will feel left out as it s boring   slow   and incredibly lifeless    what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water   and it s a shame because it could have been a great film    hypothetically   i mean       flubber     as you probably know   is a remake of the disney classic i never saw     the absent minded professor     where a   well   absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as   flubber     you know   flying rubber    the new one keeps the basic plot   but appears to have added a lot else   like more absent mindedness on the part of the proffessor   some more villains   and several   show stopping   moments   like a big rumba with the flubber   and some more elaborate setups   none which really make it any better   but instead make it worse    the basic plot revolves around a college professor   philip brainerd   robin williams     who creates lots and lots of inventions   but is sadly absent minded    in fact   he s forgotten his wedding to the college s president   sara jean reynolds   indie actress marcia gay harden     two times before he forgets it again at the beginning    doesn t this warrant some kind of mental treatment    anyway   on his wedding day   the third one     he invents the flubber   which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed   but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in   the abyss      philip believes that this invention   once fully realized   will save his college   which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon villain   chester hoenicker   raymond j   barry     which is ironically enough the same college his brat son   will wheaton   thought he was dead   goes to    through a plot twist   hoenicker s goons   named smith and wesson   ha ha   what a great sense of humor this film has   who are played by clancy brown and ted levine   both who needed the pay check     discover it the hard way   and try to steal for hoenicker   who wants it just  cause he s evil enough    a sub plot involves philip s attempts to win back sara   who s angry at him   and with good reason     but who is being seduced by who is basically philip s belloq   wilson croft   christopher mcdonald   playing the hysterically suave yet unsuave asswhole once again      and in another subplot   philip s day timer robot   weebo   voiced by the one and only jodi benson     falls in love with him    yuckity yuck    what s most pathetic about this film is how dull it is    you don t need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film   which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney   who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry   half assedly re mixing classics   or non classics   for distribution to the general public   who sadly eats it all up    earlier in  97   they released   jungle 2 jungle     an adaptation of a really awful french film     un indien dans la ville     which   yeah   improved over the original   but not by much    disney s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now   only creatively    in the rush to ship out a film for distribution   disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called   magic      such scenes as dancing flubber   a flying car   a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber   and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze   delight   or even cause people to laugh    i sat there the entire film stone faced   chuckling perhaps twice   and shaking my head at all the bad jokes    who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry    didn t think so    it doesn t help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable    philip is not a lovable absent minded professory   just a really dumb man being played by robin williams    williams is a brilliant comic actor       okay   a brilliant actor in general   but here he s given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something   and other times act sad    those times   he s not bad    but what are we supposed to think of a man who s forgotten his wedding thrice    maybe it was funny and or respectable in the 60s        i like disney   and i usually enjoy their films   not only animated but live action   and their recent films   save for   hercules     which was good   but not great   have been worse than lackluster   they ve been pathetic       jungle 2 jungle   is probably the worst film i saw last year       flubber    s probably second    what do they need to do    perhaps create something new    get writers who can write something that s universally entertaining    films like   the parent trap   and   mary poppins   are films that are live action   or in the latter case a mix of both     but even i can still watch them because they re not only written to be magical to children   but to be fun to adults    what s more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn    and my god   couldn t they have done something else with edie mcclurg

1233	1	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction   the cinematic output from its creator   quentin tarantino   has been surprisingly low    oh   he s been busy    doing the talk show circuit   taking small roles in various films   overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn   making cameo appearances on television shows   providing a vignette for the ill fated anthology four rooms    everything   it seems   except direct another feature length film    it s been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr   tarantino s new feature film   jackie brown   one of the most anticipated films of the year   and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s    things aren t going well for jackie brown   pam grier      she s 44 years old   stuck at a dead end job      16   000 a year   plus retirement benefits that aren t worth a damn     as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america    and she s just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette   portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton   and police officer mark dargus   michael bowen   smuggling  50 000 from mexico for gun runner ordell robbie   samuel l   jackson     who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry   robert forster      the loquacious ordell   based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny   bong hitting surfer girl melanie   bridget fonda   and agreeable crony louis gara   robert de niro   hang out   operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat   and he s soon out to silence jackie brown    meanwhile   the authorities  target is ordell   and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half million dollars    only through a series of clever twists   turns   and double crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses    although jackie brown marks mr   tarantino s first produced screenplay adaptation   based on the elmore leonard novel   rum punch       there s no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film    while he s adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense   the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character s now black    in terms of ambiance   the film harkens back to the 1970s   from the wall to wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets    even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions    the opening sequence featuring ms   grier wordlessly striding through the lax   funky music blaring away on the speakers   is emblematic of films of that era    the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995   but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro    of course   nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads   and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists   backstabbing   and deceptions deliciously unfold   the strength of jackie brown is the quiet   understated relationship developed between jackie and max   when they kiss   it s perhaps the most tender scene of the year    tenderness   in a quentin tarantino film    sure   there ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films    the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer   or even in reservoir dogs   where a deep   unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters    but for the most part   mr   tarantino s films are typified by manic energy   unexpected outbursts of violence   and clever   often wordy   banter    these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown   but what s new here is a different facet of his storytelling    a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent   and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation    this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr   tarantino as simply a helmer of slick   hip crime dramas with fast talking lowlifes   and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent   he s the real deal    this new aspect of mr   tarantino s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character    that of the world weary   sensitive   and exceedingly professional max cherry   whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching    mr   forster s nuanced   understated performance is the best in the film   he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie   we smile along with him    much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation era icon pam grier in the lead   with the wags buzzing that mr   tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta s then sagging career    as it turns out   ms   grier is solid in the film s title role   although nothing here forces her to test her range    i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection   though    she s been working steadily over the years   often in direct to video action flicks   but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton s mars attacks    and larry cohen s original gangstas   where she first teamed up with mr   forster      of course   it s true that her role here was a godsend    a meaty a part as this is rarity for   any   actress   let alone one of her age and current status in the industry    while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone   it marks tremendous growth of mr   tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding   and whose characterizations have never been better    and while the film s narrative doesn t really warrant a running time of 155 minutes   it s filled with such sumptuous riches   ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining   inconsequential conversations between the characters   that there wasn t an unengaging moment    with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt   it ll

833	0	one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often acclaimed director sidney lumet s   gloria     a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film   had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre    suddenly   i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before   i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in    when a movie is over   aren t we supposed to think about it for a while   and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with    i thought so   but   for one   i saw this particular picture by myself   and  2   even if i had been with someone there wouldn t have been anything to talk about in the first place    to be sure     gloria   begins with a stirring   rather poignant prologue in which a seven year old boy s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters   in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it    right before the men broke in   of course   his father gave him the disc to escape with    eventually   the boy   named nicky nunez   jean luke figueroa     is caught by the mobsters   and taken back to their apartment    meanwhile   gloria   sharon stone   has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn t commit and returns to her ex boyfriend   jeremy northam   to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime    when he refuses to give it to her   and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky   she leaves with him in order to save his life   but not before holding the men at gunpoint   stealing all of their money   and forcing them to strip nude    gloria is the type of fast talking   smart mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people   and she never expected to be stuck with a kid   but she has a heart of gold   don t they always in this type of movie   and is only trying to protect the boy   whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with    the previous incarnation of   gloria   by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands   remains unseen by me   but was no doubt superior   even though i can t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one   regardless of the director or stars    there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original   but the film itself is simply lifeless   with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn t completely unbearable to watch    i liked   for example   a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at   and keeps turning the car around   then driving a little ways   then slamming on the brakes and turning around again    these bright moments   however   appear long and far between   and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria   which is both painfully predictable and by the numbers    throughout   my mind was repeatedly asking the question     who really cares      as gloria   sharon stone has adopted an over the top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn t sound realistic at all    in the beginning   in fact   i was amazed at how amateurish stone s performance was   but as the film progressed she got better    although not one of her better turns   stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored    jean luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag    all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted   none more than cathy moriarty   an entertaining actress in her own right   who is billed fourth and has all of one scene   as gloria s friend whom she turns to for help    sony   the studio that released   gloria     obviously does not have any faith in the film   and i don t blame them    they declined to screen the picture for critics   which is never a good sign   particularly with the high profile people involved    although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is   just look at the spectacular   in dreams     which failed to even make the top 10 last week     i have a suspicion   gloria   is going to vanish from theaters faster than   ishtar     judging from the opening night 7   00 p   m   showing i saw it at   where there were about ten to fifteen people present   counting myself    although stone can be an impressive actress   just watch her in 1995 s   casino   or 1996 s   last dance   if you don t believe me   and sidney lumet can be a respectable director   there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of   gloria   was worth remaking or   for that matter   why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful    
609	0	i feel sorry for the financial backers of   waterworld     which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made   at  172 million       and is also one of the stupidest   boy did they get ripped off    in fact   this film is not really a movie   but more of an amusement park ride with a plot    it s not even just another case of cliches strung together   well   it is that too     it s something that s painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws    kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man half fish    he is an explorer mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted    he s referred to as the mariner   but they   the meaner   would have been a more appropriate title because he s cold   rigid   and strict   and he s supposed the be the good guy    he docks at a small floating village of sorts    he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters    first we meet one of the villains   then the soon to be heroine   a child prodigy   a wacky inventor   and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today   but also some of the low tech tools used by pirates and vikings    immediately the film s biggest flaw is apparent   are these people primitive or highly advanced    it doesn t seem like anyone can read yet they have ski doos and airplanes    how are these things powered    and if they have airplanes   couldn t they just keep flying until they reached dry land    also   if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things    i m sorry   i m all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies   but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us    there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology   so why mix the two together    it doesn t make any sense    there really isn t much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything    the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child   enola   mojorino     has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to   dryland      who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out    we never get an answer   just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland    to make a long   boring   stupid   and just plain bad story short   the mariner escapes with a woman named helen   tripplehorn   and enola    they sail for a long time   encountering some strange people in the process and fight off   the smokers   as lead by the idiot villain deacon   hopper     who kidnaps enola    the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons   rescuing enola   and bringing them all to salvation   how original      even with all its special effects   action   and adventure this film is boring    not a single character is likable   therefore neither is the plot    dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson s joker   while costner just plain rips    still     waterworld   is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it    i just hope they don t make a sequel    
995	0	salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets    actors who demand such salaries might be greedy   but in some instances they are quite justified   because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation    proof for that can be found even in the realm of low budget movies   and one fine example is breakaway   1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring   in   famous figure skater tonya harding    face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie s poster   but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra   attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster    one day she decides to retire   but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that    realising that her life suddenly became worthless   myra starts running for her life   followed by professional assassins    terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater    although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities   her acting leaves much to be desired    on the other hand   her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality   believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b films a bad name    martin sheen s brother joe estevez   whose character looks like he had entered from another movies  set   is the only bright spot of breakaway    unfortunately   he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding s silver screen debut proved to be her last film    
72	0	it rocks actually   lots of rocks fly at us or from us   in slow or fast motion   at several points in the film    they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air

nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur      they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon   a steroid user s answer to deep impact    bruce willis stars as harry stamper   a famed oil driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond   zero barrier   and destroys our planet    why an oil driller    they require someone experience with deep core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid       in one unintentionally        hilarious sequence   nasa asks harry to inspect a deep core driller they built based on his blueprints   it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it    we trust nasa to build space shuttles      harry assembles the obligatory   ragtag   bunch of   cowboys     including a blond guy   a fat guy   a black guy   a wiseass   and the man who is sleeping with his daughter   affleck      once they reach space   we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it   i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes    whether or not they save the day   i will not reveal    nor will you care    i will say this   you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope    willis has barely a chance to come alive   ditto for affleck    their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act   in a last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material    steve buscemi s character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic       rockhound     as he s called   is sarcastic and foolish   so they tape him to a chair   where he spends most of the film    so why did they bring him up there to begin with    rather   why write him into the film    give  his almost witty one liners to serious willis   who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies   at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter   firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig    i m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel   at least in my world where the sky is blue    liv tyler is pretty and humourless   as always   suspiciously   four of her father s band s     aerosmith     songs grace the soundtrack    director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick   like ketchup   eventually drowning the movie on screen       the middle hour is a non sensical   pyrotechnic assault on the average primate s brain      whenever someone dies in this movie   a crew member inevitably yells out   we lost   insert dead person s last name here        i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil guy cum astronaut from a live one   and close ups of the corpses  faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance   as their skin was often covered in fake blood    armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla    it looks nicer   and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework    it has a vivid soundmix    but at almost two and a half hours   i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story    the love story has been played up in the ads   perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever    bollocks    the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon crawler    remember a little film called jaws    in this film   three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark    they didn t much like each other at first   eventually   they started to respect one another    one of jaws  great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories    this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer   jerry bruckheimer   who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end    not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances i d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before   action   was called    a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don t bare their souls   who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest beating bravery    to this   i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic   nor brave   nor smart   even   this team couldn t build a birdhouse    and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer a trailer for a movie written by a team of body builders and greeting card authors i ve never been a prouder wimp my whole

the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people    for me   they calibrated my creativity as a child   they are masterful   original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time   and they still hold up pretty darn well      i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release   but that doesn t make me any less dedicated to it    on the contrary   the star wars trilogy    and the empire strikes back in particular    are three items on a very short list of why i love movies    when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine film series   i got exited    when i first saw screenshots from the film   well over a year ago   i embarked on a year long drool of anticipation    and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving   i was ready to see the film    but then there was the hype   the insane marketing campaign   and lucasfilm s secretive snobbery over the picture    in the last weeks before the picture opened   while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater   i was tired of hearing about it    i was tired of seeing cardboard cut outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell    i just wanted to see the movie    reader   do not misunderstand    i did not have an anti hype reaction    the hype was unavoidable    i understand and accept the hype    it s just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released    five minutes into the phantom menace   i knew there was a problem       who are these jedi knights      i asked       why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine gun rapidity         why aren t these characters being developed before their adventures         why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film      these were just some of my questions early on    later   i asked     where s the magic of the first three films      and   why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes      by the end of the film   i was tired   maddened   and depressed    george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless   mindless   summer blockbuster    the phantom menace is no star wars film    take away the title and the jedi talk and the force   and you re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time    it s an embarrassment    i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored   or a new theme is examined   or a special effects shot isn t used    there are a few of each   but they re all token attempts    the fact is   george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects    this is not what i wanted to see    i didn t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth   but i did    the story centers mostly around qui gon jinn   liam neeson   looking lost and confused   and his apprentice   obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   who scarcely has a line in the film   and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo    naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation   their contact on naboo is queen amidala   natalie portman     the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people    after picking up jar jar binks   a completely cgi character   voiced by ahmed best     they head to tatooine   where they meet young anakin skywalker   jake lloyd   and his mother   pernilla august      qui gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin   and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys    the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious   neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters    there isn t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form    the way lucas has handled it   however   it unsatisfactory    first of all   we don t learn one single thing about qui gon jinn    not one thing    what was his life like before this film    well   i imagine he didn t have one    that s why he feels like a plot device    this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role   and why he s recently retired from film   i don t blame him   honestly      obi wan   a character i was really looking forward to learning more about   is even less interesting    mcgregor has just a few lines   so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere    since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace   lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie    things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine   young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed out character in the film   and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role    i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene   rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting    and when anakin says goodbye to his mother   i found it moving    also fairly good is portman   and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written    jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i ve ever had to endure   but he s more interesting than most of the humans    as soon as the relatively brief segment on tatooine is over   it s back to the mind numbing special effects and depthless action scenes    i ve seen many movies that qualify as   special effects extravaganzas     but the phantom menace is the first one i ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie    the reason is obvious   george lucas has no restraint    i can t say that i didn t find the effects original   because i did    the final battle between darth maul   obi wan   and qui gon is visually exceptional   as is most of the film    but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome    my breaking point was near the end of the picture   as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters   in the background   we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky   and i wanted that to go away    can t we have one stinking scene that isn t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot    i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours    and then there s the question of magic    what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi    i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel    john williams  familiar score is no help   nor is lucas  direction    i think it comes right down to characters   there are none here    i longed for the magnetic presence of han   luke   and leia   but i got no such thing    and what about the ridiculous expectations    mine weren t that high   i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving   a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects    instead   i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show    i don t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it   i d like to forget that it exists   and yet i can t    it s here to stay    i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them   because if they don t   then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series    
455	0	i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard    the problem is   i can t remember them as i write this review    that s not a good sign    in booty call   jamie foxx is bunz   a character whom i can t really describe   because i don t know that much about him    i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk   and that he doesn t like relationships   just   booty calls   at three in the morning   no questions   no commitment      bunz has a best friend named rushon   tommy davidson     who seems to be bunz s direct opposite   on the straight and narrow   and currently in a long term commitment   a whole seven weeks   wow        rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend   nikki   tamala jones     but for a reason which is not totally explained   it s going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki s friend lysterine   vivica a   fox     who have never met    to make a long story short   the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki s obsession with safe sex    first she wants condoms   so bunz and rushon go out and get them    oh   no   they have to be latex   not lambskin    back to the store    now they ve got to get dental dams   or there ll be no foreplay    why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand    nikki phones lysterine   who lives across the hall   and tells her she d better be making these demands   too    talk about coitus interruptus    booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over the top comedies    the difference between the two is that in the latter   things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality    in this category   for example   you have ace ventura   private eye on the mild side   and airplane    at the extreme    there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status   but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention    it is disappointing   and even worse   distracting    there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker   are those real names      does not live up to its potential   as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing    for instance   there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant    bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese   much to everyone s surprise    however   when asked how he learned the language   he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late night kung fu films   and soon gained mastery    this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene    if   on the other hand   when asked how he learned to speak chinese   bunz simply replied with     kung fu movies     and then moved on   the joke would have been much more effective    this is because it would have been totally unbelievable   but funny because we know it is unbelievable    by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible   the film is not giving its viewers enough credit    the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions    why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends    why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine    if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex   why doesn t she have some condoms at her own apartment    these questions are not answered by the screenplay   but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward    a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language    some movies use a lot of swear words   but use them under very justifiable circumstances   as when they are employed consistent with a character s pattern of speech    other films   such as the recent jackie brown   use them in ways that almost parody themselves    booty call just sticks them in to get laughs   and it doesn t work    they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them    half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason    the chinese restaurant   a holdup at a convenience store   and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story   and are in there for filler    this is surprising   considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long    it s too bad that the core of the film isn t much better   since it is comprised of sometimes funny   but forgettable dialog    i refer you to the first paragraph of this review    
1395	1	plot   odin is a great high school basketball player    he s dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass    in fact   the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him    unfortunately   the coach s real son   hugo   isn t too pleased to hear that    in fact   he doesn t like hearing about any of odin s triumphs   as they generally supersede his own    so what does he set out to do    well   let s just say that he starts to mess with people s heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to       well    you ll see    critique   a very powerful   thoroughly depressing   well acted   non teen   movie starring a bunch of teens    credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic   set in a realistic high school environment   with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core    you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film   who turn over some very convincing performances   taking you through all of their characters  ups and downs    hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character   a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of   sign of a good actor   if you ask me      phifer also comes to play in this movie   with a nice blend of charisma   fear   love and anger spread over his character    i was always on this guy s side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along    julia stiles was also good   but her character wasn t much different from others that she s played recently    i was however very surprised with martin sheen s showing   since i hadn t taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years    his character is definitely over the top in this film   but i appreciated his fervor   his rage   his ultimate and blind desire to win above all    a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest    i did have a few reservations about the movie though    first of all   what was with all of the gangsta hip hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition    it was cute at first   but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times    the film was also edited pretty choppily       like  some scenes were cut out and no one   cleaned it up   afterwards    i also didn t like the fact that hartnett s character   the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film   was infallible    in other words   pretty much everything he says or asks of someone   happens automatically and without any goofups    i mean   i know the guy is smart and all   but i would have appreciated a little more   realism   under some of the circumstances    but overall   the movie will devastate you    it s not a   fun date movie      it s not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks    it s about jealousy   love   envy   fury   passion   revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that s ever passed through your head    is it worth seeing    oh   most definitely       pun intended   it s a moving picture with great performances   no shakespearian speak   thank you   god     and an outstanding directorial job by nelson    the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine   and i was especially impressed with the director s choice of music near the end    in fact   the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver   and i guess that s saying something right there    where s joblo coming from    10 things i hate about you   7 10     election   7 10     hamlet   6 10     love s labor s lost   8 10     natural born killers   9 10     save the last dance   7 10     shakespeare in love   5 10    
614	0	joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory    the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it    it has a solid cast with tom hanks   meg ryan as the lead roles    but you can never judge a movie by its cast        if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano   it is that the plot is original    unfortunately   it is also incredibly stupid    the movie begins with joe   tom hanks   going to work    this opening sequence is very boring and slow    it shows joe walking to his office    but on the way   he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting    a sequence like this should take 2 minutes    here   it takes over 5        it is obvious that joe hates his job    at his office   one of his co workers is meg ryan    oddly enough   she plays 3 different roles in this movie      joe leaves to go to a doctor s appointment    his doctor informs him that he has a   brain cloud      this means that in a few months   he will die    so what does joe do    quit his job   of course      when he arrives home   joe meets an old man named graynamore   lloyd bridges      graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island   the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god    by a startling coincidence   the boat trip to the island takes a few months    by the time he reaches the island   he will almost be dead from the   brain cloud   anyway   so joe agrees    graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this   great adventure      joe goes on a date with meg ryan   his co worker    the day before the boat trip   joe meets one of graynamore s daughters    she is also   surprise   meg ryan    except she looks more hippyish    they both have dinner and the next day   joe gets driven over to his boat    the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore s daughters    and   wonder of wonders   she is also played by meg ryan    as they sail to the island   meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda    after some stupid talking scenes   they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to    and that the   brain cloud   thing was made up      they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage    joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark    this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times    but   to top it off   the shark is obviously rubber and fake      one night there is a storm    a cheap looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard    fortunately   joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail    by pure luck   they get to the island    since the natives like orange soda   they wear soda cans as attire      stupid or what         before joe leaps in the volcano   he gets fed    right before he jumps   meg ryan pleads him not to    when joe decides to   she goes in with him because   she loves him      now this is where the movie should end    but   unfortunately   the   cheesy ending   bug comes in    the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joe s luggage    they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers    i give this movie a    see it only if you re a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan        
1148	1	seen may 19   1999 at 5 p   m   at the crossgates cinema 18   guilderland   n   y       theater  1   with my brother john for  8   50     theater rating             excellent seats   sound and picture      critic s note   this review is the longest i ve ever written and still only scratches the surface    i d recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis      as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of  the phantom menace    how do i even write this review    never mind the fact that i ve been waiting for a new  star wars  movie since i was seven years old    never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released    never mind that there s so much going on in this movie in terms of plot   action   special effects and long term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn t cover everything    and also like ted does in all of his reviews   i ll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you   the reader    before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film   many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered   to get the specifics of the film   skip this and the next four paragraphs      as has been made obvious for the last several years   another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the  missing  initial three installments of the  star wars  series   the first of the films was actually episode four   not one      george lucas   the creator of the series   has probably just assumed most people know the first produced trilogy    star wars      the empire strikes back  and  return of the jedi    is actually the second trilogy   chronologically    in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order   but i can t recall his reasons    with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy   err        second trilogy        well you know what i mean      and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which   unfortunately   may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution     critic s note  1   it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed   but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule    critic s note  2   reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics  law of reviewing movies   which as roger ebert coined    it s not what a movie is about   but how it is about it      because so many outside factors come into play in the film s plot and significance as part of a trilogy   and just considering modern society   it again would be difficult   if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story      first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it    we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker   who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire    we know obi wan  ben  kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of  the force  in attempts to become a jedi knight   but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the  dark side      we also know something about  the force  itself   that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it   the jedi      what we don t know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy   which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth    to me   this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle   definite order to all the complexity    also   it seems that we re supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended    most notably   details regarding the emperor from  empire  and  jedi     and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine    for those who haven t kept up with all the  star wars  paraphernalia over the years   there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor   or his voice at least      with  the phantom menace  being the first chapter of a long saga   one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid   including the history behind all the major factors of the series   especially  the force  and the jedi knights    unfortunately   this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained    i didn t liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness    if you re going to tell a story from the beginning   tell it from the beginning   is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes  1 through  3 to clarify the back story even further        but i digress    i ve said so much and yet i haven t even touched on the specifics of the film itself    all these necessary  disclaiming  elements should go to show just how vast the story of the  star wars  series is and this individual film itself    what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we ve come to know and love since the late 1970s    its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar   but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality    the basic story is rather sorted   complex and even confusing at times    we re told that an army known as  the trade federation  has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo    we re not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is   instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly    we re introduced to two jedi   the master qui gon jinn   neeson   and his apprentice obi wan kenobi   mcgregor      the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet s queen   amidala   portman      the leader of the federation   an alien called viceroy   is following the orders of a strange   mythical character   an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears    he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance   and especially that creepy evil voice of his   he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series    sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person    clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity   which is never openly revealed in the film   but should be clear to most viewers    i have a feeling we ll delve into his background in the next two films      but it doesn t take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film s story begins to move along    the film doesn t have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini plot and adventure on top of another    there are so many of these mini plots within plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook    the other films have relied on this type of storytelling   but because of the limits of the technology at the time   the films  screenplays were also limiting    the sense of limitlessness here is what gives  the phantom menace  its unique traits    as we already know   the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original  star wars  trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story    and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10 year old anakin skywalker   lloyd     by qui gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council    to briefly summarize the story   jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala s spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation    their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force    jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force   and through another sub plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter   more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves    this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before    in fact   it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before    the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary    by the film s third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot    it s funny how the reality of the  star wars  world seems so embedded in mythology   new age like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence    not that this technique hasn t been used in movies and in real life situations countless times throughout history    and at least it s all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter    it does border of the cartoonish sometimes   but that s just the film appealing to our inner child   which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society     the phantom menace  delivers exactly what you d expect from a  star wars  film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness    so many things in the film we ve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited    but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies    
1078	1	logical time travel movies are a near impossibility    considering that the skeptic s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities   writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task    occasionally   we get a film that does manage it    terry gilliam s   12 monkeys   was one such film    but more frequently   we get films that don t much deal with it at all    there is one question to ask in this case   does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies    the   terminator   films made up for them with exciting action     back to the future   did it with an entertaining story   and the new film   frequency   pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own    is   frequency   filled with plot holes    yes    does it matter    not really    the film opens in october of 1969    firefighter frank sullivan   dennis quaid   puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job   then goes home to his loving wife julia   elizabeth mitchell   and son johnny   daniel henson      the double pronged story flashes forward to 1999   where johnny   now jim caviezel   is all grown up and working as a police detective    a strange occurrence    the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city    allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in  69 and that john has found in the present day    though both are initially skeptical of the idea   john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire   and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom    now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive   john is initially overjoyed   until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous   a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women    frank and john now must work together to set things right   with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past    the premise of   frequency   is unusual   and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept   john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions    this isn t explained   you just have to go with it    when frank doesn t die in a fire   john is the only one who remembers it differently   while everyone else remembers it the new way    the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities    1969 and 1999    are to each other    sometimes frank s changing the past results in something happening right away in john s world   and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time    now   the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this   and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted   but nevertheless logical   if i thought about it hard enough   for example   the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer s murders was because the change had already happened in frank s world   and john is only witnessing the   projection   of that change     but explanations aren t really the point    when   frequency   gets cooking   it s a riveting little thriller   even if it is confusing    what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment   and   frequency   works as long as it keeps moving    the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion    director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure   frequency   as good hollywood entertainment   establishing decent   likable characters   making us care for them   and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved    i liked many of the creative touches   the split screens   allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities   and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward    it actually uses the 1969 mets orioles world series   the one that featured the amazin  mets   to great effect    frank uses john s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him       admittedly   this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself      i even liked the final scene   which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods    some may find this scene blindingly confusing   as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious   but it does make sense if you think about it   and give the script a lot of leeway     and let s face it   it s a darn cool way to end the film    there are enough surprises and plot twists in   frequency   to keep you on your toes   and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant    the other major thing to appreciate about   frequency   is the handling of the father son relationship    quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily   it s a rock solid job from both actors    the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept   how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative   or with a future descendant    watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question    the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film   if we don t believe in the characters   we don t care about the outcome of the thriller plot    here   we do care   because we like the lead actors    i also liked some of the supporting cast members    elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles   playing julia the doting wife   and   mother   but still performs admirably    andre braugher   late of the television show   homicide   life on the street     gives a nice supporting turn as frank s best friend and future colleague of john    he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank s world series predictions come true before his very eyes    braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here   simultaneously dismayed and amused    perhaps the only thing i didn t like about   frequency   is the overly sentimental coda   during which the camera s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard    but that s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics    i freely acknowledge that   frequency   may best work as a   guy   movie   since it focuses on the very male oriented idea of father son relationships   echoes of   field of dreams   can be easily heard     but the underlying concept is universally applicable    who wouldn t want to speak with a long dead parent    or see how their children turn out       tell me about your life   son      excuse me while i mist up    and don t call me a sissy    
546	0	one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric     you d better watch out for the skin deep      i d like to extend the same warning   watch out for skin deep   but whatever you do don t watch skin deep    skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards    john ritter stars as zach   a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big time drinking problem    i never saw edwards  comedy the man who loved women   but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake    you see   to put it mildly   zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets    as the movie opens   zach s wife   alex   catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress  hairdresser    like any sensible wife   alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him    in response   zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking   womanizing   psychotherapy   and self discovery    if you re turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink   get arrested   have sex   drink   crash his mercedes   have more sex   drink   get arrested again   drink   and sing horrendously at the piano   then skin deep should be right up your alley    skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters    zach is a rich    80s l   a   version of ritter s jack tripper character from   three s company      like jack   zach is clumsy and inept   he s the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye    zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic   but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him    consequently   i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis    in fact   when zach crashes his ex wife s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying   i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony    to add insult to injury   edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work    for instance   vincent gardenia s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender    of all the women in the film  and there are many  alyson reed   alone   stands out as zach s wife   reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role    because we don t care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep   the film s few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail    the comedy in skin deep doesn t fare much better    most of the jokes are dumb   predictable   and sitcomish    about every ten minutes   however   edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight gag   the most effective of which involves a pair of   dueling   condoms    overall   the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat    my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism    zach s excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life   but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain    zach s drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences    if he crashes his mercedes   he gets a new one    if he gets arrested   his lawyer bails him out of jail    if his wife leaves him   she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he ll clean up his act    the tone in skin deep is all wrong   edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly   making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter    perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or   better yet   michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep

1781	1	recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville one from entertainment weekly   one from a newsgroup   and two from different online resources    each review compared this film to the truman show    why    the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television    other than that   the two movies are completely different from each other    reviewers seem to love to pick one movie   i   e    the truman show     obsess over it   and make it a guideline for other movies    when pleasantville and edtv opened   all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman    the same goes for the thin red line   as well    when it opened in decemeber   probably 98  of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg s saving private ryan   giving thin line no chance whatsoever    critics loved private ryan so much   that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards    this is why i think pleasantville was underrated    if the truman show had never been made   pleasantville probably would have received better reviews   done better at the box office   and would be remembered after it s long been on the video store shelves    sure   it wasn t perfect   and it wasn t very believeable   but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars   and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history    with the exception of don knotts as the annoying   tv repairman   the film is cast perfectly   the ice storm s tobey maguire is david in real life   he watches the old 50 s sitcom   pleasantville   to escape from his feuding parents    his twin sister   jen   reese witherspoon   is a popular slut who   steriotypically   smokes and wears revealing clothes    but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue those excessive 90 s terms such as   like       whatever     and   cool   make her sound like the total dimwit she s supposed to be    the twins   with a little help from a tv repairman   casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo esque cast rather than a true acting one     are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote    their new parents   played by william h   macy and joan allen   are perfect in every way    their new names are bud and mary sue   and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville    after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles   the movie begins to take form    it s just like watching a sitcom in itself   you don t want it to end       mary sue   has sex with her date   the school basketball champion   when he tells all his friends about it   they stop preforming perfectly at basketball   and things start to take color    soon we learn that these people don t know how to express true emotions   and when they learn to do so   they eventually turn into color    this eventually sparks a racial war between the   coloreds   and the   black   whites      entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has     none of the depth   poignance   and brilliance of the truman show          yes   the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent    but the racial setting intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom certainly classifies as deep   considering it s what i least expected    gary ross did not try to create an intelligent   award masterpiece he just tries to convey moral messages within his work    take for example big and dave   his past films    big be careful what you wish for    dave good or bad lying is still lying    did these movies win big awards    no   but they won the heart of millions    pleasantville could have done that too   if it wasn t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films    pleasantville   a  ad2am   i almost lost my nose       and  i like it    i like breathing through it       jack nicholson   chinatown  
228	0	not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie    earlier this year   nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year s least likeable   comedies   called hanging up   featuring a bunch of annoying women   ironically   lisa kudrow played one in that film as well   who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves    ick       real  sweet stuff    but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer   with a film entitled battlefield earth    i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film   even if it was on a   cheese   factor   as everybody   and i mean everybody else   pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time    yipes       another  beauty    so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co starring the ever versatile lisa kudrow    uhhhm   you guessed it       not  much    plot   in order to escape major financial difficulties   a local weatherman hooks up with his ball picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery    but as more and more people find out about their scheme   more and more people demand a part of their winnings   and more and more problems arise    critique   simply stated   i didn t laugh once during this entire picture    for a comedy   it offered me a few smiles   a bunch of nincompoops as characters   a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow   in what can only described as a   sluttier   version of her character of phoebe on tv s   friends      this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be   but it was pretty close    thankfully   the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits   dancing as the weatherman were left in the film s trailer   and not in this final cut    and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far   beautiful   this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic   idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast    foremost was travolta s character   who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie    and for me   the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong    he didn t fit the part    i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role    a cool   calculating roughneck with a certain hip   suave   je ne sais quoi      in this film   he looks like he s trying to be funny   trying to be bad   trying to be good    we re not supposed to be able to notice that   and when we do   at least in my case   i consider it a wrong choice in casting    add that to lisa kudrow   boring us with yet another one of her patented   dumb blonde   routines   but this time   dressed in sexier outfits    michael rapaport   stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn t quite up at the same speed level as everyone else    and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells   and you ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize    the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half interesting and never really bored me    i also liked michael moore s perverted cousin character   and i loved   and i say it again   loved the character that bill pullman played    give this dude his own movie    he played a lazy cop   a man who tries everything not to do any real work    he fakes injuries to get off duty   tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won t have to fill out any forms       now  there s a base of humor    sadly   the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film    and there s not much else i can say about this movie   folks    on the whole   it was lame   included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines   and very little of interest for any target audience    but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i m there    
1894	1	perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects    there is no question that action adventure and science fiction action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise    whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years   such as raiders of the lost ark   were made in grand traditional fashion   contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion dollar creations of computer technology    the latest in this visually awesome series of movies   the wachowski brothers  the matrix   is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie s story    unlike many sci fi movies which promote themselves as effects heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise   the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event    it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose   and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film s length    contrary to popular trend   the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound    in this regard   the movie is something like a card sharp    with its flashy mass stripped away   the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented    the script is characteristically weak   and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach    but   like the card sharp   the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent    the viewers don t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner    and right around the corner they usually are   for the script tells a fast paced   albeit frequently revisited story    as the movie explains   the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind    billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence    the matrix      farms   our life energy    only a select group of individuals knows of the   real   world   and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra cool morpheus   laurence fishburne      morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo   keanu reeves     believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth    the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion    the set design is very dynamic   running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy    the costumes   as well as the actors who wear them   add to the roles    for instance   the manifested antagonists in the movie   a group of   agents   created by the matrix in its computer program   all dress in matching secret servicewear   the rebel fighters   on the other hand   dress in rich hues of leather    the casting cannot be criticized   for the typically stoic reeves isn t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool    supports in carrie anne moss   joe pantoliano   and hugo weaving are all effectual    one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year s science fiction masterpiece dark city   particularly if one ponders how this same premise would ve worked from a different approach    the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective   requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear   here   the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise    the better picture between the two depends on the viewer   but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun    
1273	1	you may not have heard of lucas   or if you have   you might not think much of it    probably because it stars corey haim   or maybe because it s about a little geek who collects insects   or maybe because it doesn t feature slick one liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80 s    however   you have been missing out on a true masterpeice   the best film of 1986   and the best film about adolescent life ever made    corey haim stars as lucas bligh   a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair   thick glasses   and an interest in insects and other outdoor life    one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him    her name is maggie   a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty   with lovely red hair and a sweet   innocent complexion    maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her   but somehow he interests her   and soon they are talking and getting to know one another    they gradually become good friends   and spend the summer together doing various things   such as studying insects   namely locusts   who come out of hiding once every 17 years     playing tennis   and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover    lucas is obviously in love with maggie   and while she is charmed by him   it s clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend    this is not clear to lucas   however    he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate   and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what s about to happen    we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally    they throw him on stage   right in front of his beloved maggie    surprisingly   he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around   but he takes it too far   and is embarassed in front of the entire school    the next scene is brilliant    maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally    she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened    he rails back against her   in a cruel unfair fashion    in lesser movies this would ve turned into a confrontation between the two characters    but maggie is written smarter than that    she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him    next we are introduced to another great character named cappie   charlie sheen      he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend    what s interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks    of course anyone with a brain can tell what s gonna happen next    cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas  relationship    this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone    she s been assigned to show him how to operate the washer dryer so he can clean his shirt    maggie is charmed by cappie s tender undertsanding demeanor   not to mention his shirtless body    this scene is so delicate and sweet   but cappie still has a girlfriend   preventing either one from acting on their desires    desperately trying to puncture the tension   cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room    it s not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend   in the films only subpar scene      lucas finally figures out what s going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance    this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself   such as try out for the football team    the last third of the film revolves around this attempt    while the idea seems cliched   the way it is executed is not    there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up    dave grusin s memorable score   played at the perfect moments   certainly helps    lucas is filled with great performances    forget everything you know about corey haim    back in 1986 he had talent   and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3 dimensional performance filled with anger   humor   and pain    kerri green is very appealing as maggie   showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her    sheen s cappie is almost too good to be true   but sheen makes him beleivable   especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas    there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti s ben   a friend of lucas   whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks    also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina   the girl who admires lucas from afar    when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s   you hear john hughes this and john hughes that    lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so called classics    but hopefully   like with heathers and say anything   lucas can begin to find it s own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald    it deserves more than that   but i don t want to be greedy

1658	1	i had lost all faith in pg 13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults    the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete   as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating    however   after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u 571   my bias is beginning to go away    both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers    even better   i didn t think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts    everyone loves surprises    u 571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets    this may be true   but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director co writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal   to blow the audience s socks off    set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u boats   u 571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship    there s only one problem   the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as   you guessed it   u 571    it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors   led by an interim captain named tyler   matthew mcconaughey     to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships    the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors   most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear      once the crew gets on the u boat   the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down    as soon as the action starts   it does not stop and luckily   because it is so exciting   i didn t want it to stop    this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises   from the wonderful   heart pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men   make sure you see this at a theater with surround sound   otherwise   do not see it all    the best parts of u 571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations    throughout the movie   several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler s job as stressful as possible    germans gun down their own men   tyler s mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory   another sailor   erik palladino   threatens mutiny    all of these examples   and several others   increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler s every move    they also make u 571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while

700	0	well   here s a distasteful   thoroughly amateurish item that   surprisingly   was actually a box office hit at the time of its release    after just viewing the film for the first time   my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie    it is cheap   idiotic   unfunny   and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was    at least some smut would have livened things up a bit       porky s     tells the story   if you can call it that   of four clueless high school buddies   pee wee   dan monahan     billy   mark herrier     tommy   wyatt knight     and mickey   roger wilson     whom desperately want to get laid    women   for the most part   are a mystery to them   and in this movie   they are to the audience   as well   since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet      their plan is sidetracked   however   when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky s   which they are able to get into using fake id s    after they pay the manager one hundred bucks for three hookers   they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building    for these four teenage guys   this means war on porky s       porky s     ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level    as a teenage sex romp   it is not wild or amusing enough    as a comedy   all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat    as a look back at the 1950 s   it is something   i suspect   most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave    and as a revenge movie   it is a crushing bore    one of the most offensive things about     porky s     is how jaw droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers    the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters   and we learn very little about them   except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool    that sure is revealing information    the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark    the women are all treated as objects or comedy props   rather than real people    for example   the two gym teachers   mrs   balbricker   nancy parsons   and honeywell   kim cattrall     only have one purpose   and that is to be made fun of    mrs   balbricker is a gruff   no holds barred   overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness   and   in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved   honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog    there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses   even though i have the suspicion they are not     but one thing is for sure   they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny   only humiliating    to prove how out of touch this so called comedy is   compare it to other more serious 80 s films about teenagers   and it looks even worse in comaprison    any of the john hughes pictures   such as 1984 s   sixteen candles     or   1985 s   the breakfast club     put     porky s     at an even greater shame    those films actually dealt with serious teen matters   but remained a great deal funnier   thanks to their bright and truthful writing    and heck   if     porky s     wanted to be a teenage sex movie   i d take 1982 s   fast times at ridgemont high     or 1982 s   the last american virgin     over this any day of the week    director bob clark is not a bad director    two years after he made     porky s     he directed the nostalgic holiday classic     a christmas story      i would forgive him for this misfire   in fact   if it wasn t for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay    just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage   and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world   is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in     porky s      
1112	1	plot   a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention    the boys eventually get together to split the money   but as plans change   double crosses occur   dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road    who s on the up and up   who s the real bad guy and who s gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie    critique   the funnest movie that i ve seen so far this year    it s got style   it s got tough guys talkin  shite and it s got plenty of bullets to go around    a definite hunk a hunk a burnin  adventure    a guy s guy movie through and through   and one that ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff    it s not very original   it goes on for a little too long   but costner and russell make it happen   as two shite kickin  elvis lovers   who don t stop till they   more or less   drop    this movie s got some pretty intensive shoot out scenes   one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i ve ever witnessed   featuring several elvises with guns a blazin  and the king s music playing in the background   and a decent helping of double crosses   sharp dialogue and funny moments    in fact   even though the cast is filled with many name actors   b actors as they might be for the most part     most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim    but the true glue that holds this film together   other than the spirit of elvis himself   is costner and russell   who play their badass characters to the t   sure   russell s been down this road before   but costner surprised me with his nastiness    i guess he s pissed at all the box office bombs that he s been in of late   but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here    in the end   the bottom line with this movie is having fun   kickin  ass and making sure there s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards    and smoke  em if you got  em   folks    there is also this one really great show down scene between costner and a cop   that ll have you crackin  up and lovin  it all at the same time    the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next    it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background   with plenty   and i mean plenty   of camera tricks   cuts and edits   but for this kind of flick   it actually works    the film is not perfect though   it starts off with a pretty big bang   but then pulls a way of the gun on us   and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle   while characters intermingle and disperse    i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots   and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well    and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega hot in the movie    no       okay    well i just did    i coulda done without her whole   romance   angle   but to be honest   it doesn t take up much of the film   which is generally covered in blood   explosions   guts and elvis nods    try to see how many   inside   connections to the king you can guess    of course   it s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind    i also like these types of   guy   movies a lot   and even though the film doesn t bring much originality to the table   it does offer a pretty coherent story   some nice twists and turns   humor and a big ol  helping of whoop ass coming straight from costner and russell s respective boots    probably not a film for everyone   but definitely for those who enjoy the guns   the charismatic bad guys and a fun   if entirely disposable   adventure    now see how many elvis songs i ve used to pun my way through this phony review below    the elvis songs also recommend this movie    so whether you re lonesome tonight or any other night   remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets   leave your little sister at home   bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse   cause this movie ain t one to return to the sender    i really beg of you   whether you re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel   to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender    and no suspicious minds either   folks   cause i got stung by this movie   i mean it really shook me up   and unless you re the devil in disguise himself   i think you won t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either    so don t be cruel   don t turn away   don t curl up with your latest flame tonite   whether she be a hard headed woman or not   and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film    it s now or never   folks    trust me   i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i d seen so far this year is far behind me    joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building    thank you       thank  you very much      where s joblo coming from    get carter   7 10     heat   8 10     honeymoon in vegas   9

378	0	robin williams has the rarest of gifts   the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style    overwhelmingly   his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best   with the notable exception of flubber      so when i   the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams   tell you that not even williams can save his latest project   you know it s in trouble    jakob the liar is a confused   muddled little movie   a generically   uplifting   film with a fundamental contradiction   the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn t realize it    williams plays jakob haim   a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii    one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high ranking german officer for his punishment    jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast    the announcement   in english   but punctuated by a triumphant   heil hitler       is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob s ghetto    liberation   he thinks    the next day   jakob tells the news to his closest friend   a volatile prize fighter named misha   liev schreiber     who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along    soon   it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home    a crime punishable by death    this is absurdly false   but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this   the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate    the danger   of course   is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto   and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger    in a curiously irrelevant subplot   jakob finds a 11 year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home    apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered   and goes to great length to make sure of that    just why the idea frightens him is never made clear    he and the girl build an uninvolving   generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning    the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine    but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false    such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren t met   the results are far worse than if there was no hope    that s the film s biggest detriment   it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false    it s never moving because it doesn t give us anything to be moved by    jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing    robin williams doesn t inject the film with life   as a matter of fact   he seems a little out of it   as if crippled by his fake accent    he is stragely unenthusiastic   his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless   hopeless    not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent   this isn t the robin williams we know and love    in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it    here   he is more of a wannabe serious actor   an impostor    jakob the liar will be compared with last year s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a   holocaust comedy      it s not a comedy    it tries   sometimes   but it rarely works    is it a melodrama    a war movie    a character study    no   no   and no    jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can t be placed into a category   not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts

script writer billy crystal   who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co hosting   comic relief   charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg   two other paragons of self indulgence      crystal ignores a simple   but crucial   rule   for a screwball comedy to work   the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting   because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous       america s sweethearts   takes place at a press junket   where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters    it s a promising set up   but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules   thus dissipating the tension of the situation    by the end of the film   all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on   but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed    john cusack and catherine zeta jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison   a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector   hank azaria     a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp    of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together   six crossed the  100 million mark   but the prospects for their final effort   a space opus titled   time over time     are far from rosy    while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup   gwen s solo films have tanked    to make matter worse   the director of the movie   christopher walken     a   visionary   who purchased the unabomber s cabin and had it moved to his backyard   is withholding the film from the studio   insisting that the first screening be held at the junket    desperate to win over the press   the studio elects to hire lee   billy crystal     a recently fired publicist   to salvage the situation    lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation    he enlists the help of kiki   julia roberts     gwen s sister   personal assistant and whipping girl    what lee doesn t know is that kiki is in love with eddie   a fact that could temper her effectiveness    press junkets are a haven for control freaks    studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel   with food and drink always at hand    generally   on the evening of their arrival   writers are bussed to see the featured film   then ferreted straight back to the hotel    the next day   writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews    every 30 minutes or so   a producer   director   writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions   with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things    the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression   writers are free to ask what they want   but understand that if the studio dislikes a question   they may not be invited to future junkets    representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions    they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew   with the studio filming the exchanges    the   reporters   are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars   but to play it safe   the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs    placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired   but the screenplay undermines the conceit    the junket is moved from the handsome   but highly confining   four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas    for most of the film   the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds   completely safe from the eyes of the press    when they do deal with journalists   the   it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters   premise is de clawed    gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll   they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and   at the screening of the movie   everyone connected with the film goes nuts   all without any repercussions    lee certainly isn t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts   in fact   he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids    is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors    hell no   they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie    all of which underscores how billy crystal and co writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise   the comedy in   america s sweethearts   is based on barely in control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters   except that it doesn t matter because any publicity is good publicity    and thus the very set up for the film implodes   leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter    so what about the cast    julia roberts   at her best playing the underdog   is utterly charming here   although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit   and not a very convincing one   by the way      catherine zeta jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic    by casting himself as the publicist   billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on   comic relief     stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks    in supporting roles   hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed   too broad      seth green is amusing as a toadie   stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair   though he has little to work with    come to think of it     little to work with   is the operative phrase for this movie    as a hollywood satire     america s sweethearts   is toothless    as a romance   it is at best a minor pleasure    such a good cast   such a waste of their efforts    had it not been taken long ago   a better title for the film would have been   much ado about nothing      
1317	1	confession time   i have never   ever seen gone with the wind    i don t know why   really    haven t wanted to check it out on video   haven t been at home the nights it was on network tv   and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big screen    so right up front   i ll admit that i don t know what the heck i m talking about   but here goes        is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990 s    maybe that s going a little bit too far    as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie   they re no clark gable and vivien leigh    but        the parallels are there    gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available    technicolor    titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors    gwtw places america s greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story   titanic does the same with the atlantic s most legendary tragedy    they both have strong willed redheaded heroines   they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves steerage bums   they were both incredibly expensive and popular        ok   maybe that s not enough parallels    so titanic s not in gwtw s league    no matter    titanic is a great movie in its own right   complete with spills   thrills and   especially   chills    much has been made of the humongous cost of the production   and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again    the money was obviously well spent    the costumes look great   the sets look great   the cgi graphics look great    i especially liked the expensive little touches   like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks    but writer director producer james cameron s real challenge in writing directing  producing titanic wasn t just costuming and set design and special effects    cameron s major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in    he succeeds masterfully    cameron does two things that work incredibly well    first   he shows us modern day salvage operations on titanic   that s just   titanic     not   the titanic     mind you      the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state   corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic   from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett   bill paxton      television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101 year old rose calvert   gloria stuart     who survived the wreck in 1912    stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role   narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew    secondly   cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character   and the romantic triangle between rose   winslet     her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley   billy zane   and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon   dicaprio      the way that big budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all star cast   so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people    cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack   while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board    the supporting cast is professional   but mostly anonymous    other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown   there s no moment when you stop and say   oh   yeah   i know him   what s he been in       although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform   or even as the ill fated engineer      the love story itself is rather conventional    i think some reviewers found it weak   and that may be a fair criticism    the performances are the key here    zane has the meatiest part in the movie   and he plays the arrogant   condescending steel millionaire to the hilt    he s smooth   he looks great in a tuxedo   and he s a convincing enough jerk that the winslet dicaprio relationship looks plausible    at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat   you can hear the wheels in his mind turning   saying not   can i save this little girl        but   can she help me get on a lifeboat      dicaprio is a revelation    i hadn t seen him before in anything   and didn t know what the heck to expect   really       honestly   i expected a bad irish accent   but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea   so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game      dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive   and being on the titanic   that it s hard not to like him    from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg   dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest   and he never falters    winslet s character grows up a lot during the movie   and so does her performance    at first   she s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop dead gorgeous    we know from the narration that she s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane   but there isn t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio    winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg    it s at that moment where winslet s character really comes alive    faced with real danger   she drops her spoiled rich girl mannerisms and does a splendid job    as rose and jack race around the doomed ship   looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal s fiery temper   winslet turns in a superb acting performance   mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror    of course   the most interesting character is the ship itself    cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic   and shows her in every mood    as a deserted wreck   down in the boiler room   up on the bridge   down in the hold   at the captain s table   down in steerage    and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead    cameron s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well    
321	0	a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature   beams itself onto a russian science vessel    well   this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci fi thriller    anyhow   this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the   virus  known as man    the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated   and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it    no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies   the movie is that predictable    the story is full of very shallow characters that don t do much other than subsist    the captain of the tug   played by donald sutherland   makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age   looks to be in his 60 s      to add to this we re shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields   and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks    some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific   in a typhoon no less    none of the characters seem to work together at all   they are always bickering and vying for some form of control    this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story   a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable    all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects    the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves    it looks genuinely fake   granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish    also on the topic of flaws   the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly   why    if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics   should it not be able to create them move faster    regardless   the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it    as to the actual casting for the movie   finally there is nothing to complain about    the actors were superb   but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles    having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe    watching these actors act this story out made it bearable   if barely    the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening    so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci fi thriller then you won t be too disappointed    as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens   it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect    this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv

1864	1	seen july 8   1998 at the crossgates cinema 18     albany   ny     theater  7   at 8   15 p   m   with my mom using hoyts cinema cash     theater rating         1 2   very good sound   picture   and seats   it s very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic   vivid sense of reality and life    all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters  lives   but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do    therefore     gone with the wind   deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does   in such a crafted   intricate   and entertaining manner    it s a crowning achievement   not only in filmmaking   but for storytelling itself    the film takes place in georgia before   during   and after the civil war    this plays a major factor in the film s success    to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy    it might also seem cliche   boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers    can a story set so long ago be relatable now    the film confronts all these problems   paradoxically   by not cronfronting them    it doesn t simply plug in the   right thing   at the   right time     it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant    building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media   without which   what is there to build on    we re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters   especially our main character   scarlett o hara   leigh     a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel   a cunning wit   and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time    she knows how her society works   wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her    right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be    being the most sought after woman allows her to manipulate men   and their women   to ensure she gets her way   whether it be obvious   i   e    who will be the one to get her food     or subtle   i   e    getting married just to spite someone      the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes   howard     a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him    he isn t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett   in fact   he s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his    her name is melanie   de havilland     and she is one of the sweetest   kindest   and most likable characters one will ever see    she and scarlett become very dear friends   but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her   and the love she has for her husband    her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic   it defines who she is   but doesn t give her much emotional self defense    acting a catalyst to the love triangle   and to the story as a whole is the daper   stong willed   cunning   cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler   gable      he s quite a character all right   everyone listens to what he has to say even though he s got a bad reputation    butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior    he tells everyone the much needed truth in the rigid caste like society where freewill doesn t seem to exist   everything is done out of honor and tradition    for example   in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out    this angers them   not for his lack of faith   but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that       do we have ammunition factories    do we have food    do we have a navy    all we have is tobacco      all true statements and yet the south still insists he s wrong    butler is a shifty character to be sure   but he takes such pride in his arrogance it s appealing    scarlett notices this too when she first sees him   and from the look butler gives her   we know he s not going to stop until he has her    but scarlett can t get past her need for ashley   and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story   butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever    and so the story goes on   with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life    the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband   especially after she is   marked   for life when her first husband dies    this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story    some are vital for only a few scenes   but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film    in most films only a few characters exist for support in background   but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance    even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set    the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place    the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside   real world   but these types of simple approaches are never taken    the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war    fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is    one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming     no    not my leg    don t cut off my leg      another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street   but as the camera pulls back   we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers   but it is their moaning that s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be    as the second half begins   the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north    she manages to resurrect the family plantation   but all the willpower she has can t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south s ultimate defeat    this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love  hate relationship    most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship   or lack thereof   between rhett and scarlett    each uses the other for personal gain   but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other    scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can t help but want her more every time she tries to one up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business    they say opposites attract   but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities   it borders on magnetic polarization    they need each other and know this   yet they never seem truly happy together    perhaps they mistake love for passion   and the film leaves it up to us to make this call    both have things the other wants and vice versa   but when they compromise   is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other    love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film   we re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why    gable and leigh do have great chemistry   always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture    all    none    either way is possible and it s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings    it s safe to say most of us won t live such overly dramatic lives as those in   gone with the wind     but it s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we ve just experienced a life s worth of joy and pain

which doesn t make me optimistic about future summers    godzilla is   of course   based on a series of cult movies   translation   really bad movies only a few people can tolerate   from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner owned cable stations    that this big budget remake won t rise above its roots is fairly obvious    the credits show us the origin of godzilla    in five words   nuclear explosion creates giant lizard    sounds like an enquirer headline   doesn t it    the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable   discovery   sequence    this time   a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling   if that ain t a stereotype          when he discovers the telltale radar blip    people die    cut to our protagonist   played by matthew broderick    he makes his first appearance wearing headphones   warbling along to   singin  in the rain      it s a none too subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie    no dice   bueller    from the beginning   poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla s enormous footprint    every disaster movie has to have a know it all scientist   and this time broderick is it    as the world s leading expert on radiated earthworms   and wouldn t you love to have that printed on your business card        broderick is invaluable to the government    he immediately dispels vicki lewis  theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because   hey   you can t take seriously the intellectual arguments of   newsradio   cast members    broderick instead hits the nail on the head   announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard       the radiation isn t an anamoly     he announces   and lightning strikes       i believe this is a mutated abberation     he continues   and lightning strikes again    it s vocabulary lightning   you see   activated by words of four syllables or more    meanwhile   we re introduced to our new york cast   headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist   maria patillo     broderick s former love    gee   what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time    poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer    italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she s not ruthless enough     nice doesn t get you anywhere in this town    it s dog eat dog      actually   it s lizard eat city   as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple s core    the filmmakers provide us with a one note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla       i think i ve got a bite     he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him    you can guess what happens next    similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city    hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps   one new yorker remarks     please don t tell me that s another parade      please don t tell me that s the best line you could come up with    mayor ebert is not pleased    played by the principal from   head of the class     he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option   and bickers with his assistant gene    i guess the filmmakers knew they d be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn t even bother to kiss ass    the problem is   if you re going to attack siskel and ebert   you should at least make it funny    dialogue like     didn t we agree that we weren t going to have any sweets until after the election      followed by     back off   gene     just doesn t work for me    other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character s last name and frenchman jean reno s inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york    there s even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses    as the beast heads back into hiding   broderick suggests the military lure it out with food    cue twelve dump trucks   all dropping fish into a new york intersection       broderick   that s a lot of fish      that ambush fails   but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying  50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them    yep   godzilla s with children   which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla    that s until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually   like linda tripp    godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day   so it has a lot of dumb action scenes   destructive special effects and shallow subplots    look no further than patillo s betrayal of broderick   patillo   what have i done   animal    what have i become     and the climactic   godzilla s nest   sequence in madison square garden    the main difference is   independence day was about the experience    it had a real global   patriotic element to it   and some genuinely fun characters    godzilla has lots of rain and lightning   reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak   blockbuster   juicy fruit   swatch   sprint and bumble bee tuna    yes   bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla    that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie    
1284	1	ok   let s get one thing straight right away   maximum risk is no battleship potemkin   although it does have some russians in it       but it s not too bad   really    it s the new film from ringo lam   the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood   and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium   jean claude van damme   who   you will recall   also starred in john woo s maiden hollywood effort   hard target      in lam s film   van damme plays alain moreau   a french cop   at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target   who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians    these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york   where   i suppose   they thought they wouldn t be noticed      this brother   mikhail suverov   played in his few scenes by       well    you know     becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi   almost the same thing   i guess     and is killed in france   in the movie   things happen so fast that you don t have too much time to think about how weird this all is      moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed   and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed   we wonder the same thing   i still do      in little odessa   he meets mikhail s girlfriend   alex   natasha henstridge   last seen in species     who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise en scene   she has very nice breasts   and we get to seen them briefly in this movie   it was rated r in the us but is pg here   so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do      this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow   the fugitive   hard target   or anything starring arnold   but that works to its benefit   i think    after all   one thing that s been missing from woo s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love   well   some of us do      movies like this shouldn t be too pretentious   and that is part of the problem with some of these other films   they try to be too   big   in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle    maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions   but they don t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative   not too much   anyway      the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions   even if   at times   they don t make a hell of a lot of sense      in fact   one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character   a rather overeager new york cabbie   frank van keeken from tv s   kids in the hall       who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story    unfortunately   by the time we have come to really get interested in him   he       well    you ll see    the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots    one is a fight in a russian sauna   with lots of sweaty   muscular male flesh   this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others     bullets in heads   and vodka    another   my personal favorite   is a fight in a meat packing house   featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw    and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood   as they trash those quaint french cafes   vegetable carts   and   well   french people that   we all know in our hearts   deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint    of course   the movie does have its share of silliness    for example   while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he s getting   alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head    in an unnecessarily dramatic moment   he apparently is shocked at what he sees   at what he has become    but what has he become    a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him    doesn t sound too unreasonable to me   considering the genre    but let s face it   any time van damme tries to be dramatic   he looks silly    so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films    while watching it   i was surprised   and a little disappointed   in the relative lack of pyrotechnics    but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush   after the initial excitement   there s not much left    although it s short on spectacle   lam s film leaves a better and more lasting impression   i think    i m more impressed by it now than i was while watching it   and to me   that s a good sign    go see maximum risk   but don t expect a typical hollywood action movie   expect a sort of funky hong kong hollywood action movie    the flying inkpot rating system     wait for the tv2 broadcast         a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha           pretty good   bring a friend             amazing   potent stuff               perfection    see it twice    dr t   white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore   but we don t hold this against him    
1621	1	originally launched in 1978   this popular film was re introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers    based on the mighty successful musical from broadway   grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2   6   5 10      starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles    plot   high school musical set in the 1950 s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t birds   travolta   and the innocent and pure sandy olsen   newton john   from australia    the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song   dance and humour    critique   fun loving   energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler    this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950 s   with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers    admittedly   i am somewhat biased in this opinion   since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth   grease was one of schmoe s first big screen experiences   and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble gum card collection     and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time    but apart from the nostalgic vibe   i was still extremely impressed by this film   as it continued to amuse me   despite my previous dozen or so viewings    this film took john travolta from a dim witted   sweathog   on tv s welcome back kotter   and transformed him into a movie star of spectacular proportions   saturday night fever   7   5 10   in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity      unfortunately for the rest of the cast   his popularity was not terribly contagious   despite their effective showings in this classic movie    on the down side   some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off   like when sandy sings about   drinking lemonade   and   staying out until 10   with danny in   summer nights       and the plot isn t exactly the most elaborate story line ever created   but despite these small reservations   this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time   and believe me       i  am not a fan of the musicals          make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player   as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film s absolute highlights    and don t forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards   so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you re feeling a little blue    little known facts   henry winkler   of tv s happy days  fonzie fame   turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career    both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton john during the filming of this picture    conaway eventually bowed out of the woo fest   and married newton john s sister a year later   divorced after five years

1210	1	i hate to burst your bubble   but after all the star power   mega bucks   screenwriters   directors   and cool trailers   men in black is not the best movie of the summer    it s pretty good in it s own right   yes   but i would probably split the   best movie   honors among face off   spawn   con air   and maybe event horizon    it s main problem is that it s quickly forgettable   and i can t remember one truly good scene from it    from con air   it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt    in spawn   it was the   living room hell   conclusion at the end    in event horizon   it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell s forces    and all of face off was pretty dang good    but as for men in black   the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches    i remember it not for it s humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted    and yes   i did see mimic   which is something i ll touch on in a later review    back to men in black   is it just me   or does that sound funny      i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard   etc     for those of you who aren t comic geeks   wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars   what the new yorker is to high society   what boy s life is to boy scots    okay   that one was pretty pathetic      few people know this   but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was   while not honest politician rare   very hard to find    this was after the release of the high grossing batman forever   and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o donnell were being considered for the roles   in the comic book   there were no black men in black    kind of weird   huh      all i can say is   thank god they didn t cast chris o donnell    i know i can t be the only person on the planet who thinks he s an annoying   preppie little snot        sorry    my apologies to o donnell fans    i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him   anticipating rather craftily that   if the movie was a big hit   it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely    he decided not to sell them to me   because they were   innappropriate      hmm          so now you re probably wondering why i ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years    good question    i ll move on to the movie now    as you probably already know   will smith and tommy lee jones   agents k and j   respectively   belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5   or it s nickname mib   men in black      men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear   and they re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they re here on earth    not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven t seen this movie   but a basically big roach type bug lands in a redneck farmer s yard   inhabits his body   and attempts to destroy the entire universe    not bad   eh     i have no idea why i just typed that    i m not even really paying attention anymore      the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black    i found their main headquarters to be boring   as were the   cool weapons   they had    the noisy cricket just plain sucked   no matter what anyone said    and the movie definitely surprised me in tone   although it probably shoudln t have    it s director   barry sonnenfield   is known for   black humor     directing both addams family movies    this movie was basically a   black comedy     not an action sci fi like i expected from the trailers    don t get me wrong on what i think of this movie    it s not bad   i gave it          it was mostly entertaining throughout it s run   and had a very good ending   although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it    my diagnosis for this picture   a good weekend rental   but not worth a movie ticket    of course   the movie is now long gone from theaters   but that s beside the point    i think    
1660	1	finding the courage to face life full on is a difficult task    summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job    if you re a total jerk like melvin udall is   the odds are even more against you    melvin   jack nicholson   is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be    a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship   he avoids the outside world as much as possible    his obsessive compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk       there s a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles     very small  mosaic tiles      melvin has some great lines    when his publisher s receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books   he responds   i think of men and i take away reason and accountability      don t get him wrong   he s not merely a misogynist    setting his sights higher than that   he s also a homophobe   racist   anti semite   xenophobe   animal hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors    when we first meet him   he s busy dumping a neighbor s dog down the garbage chute    he s an equal opportunity bigot    he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe    melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly   helen hunt   is the only one willing to wait on him    and she s none too happy about it    when carol doesn t show up for work   melvin s routine is shot and he s determined to do something about it    tracking down her address   he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast    the fact that she s a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn t appear to phase him   he wants his food    much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop   greg kinnear   is brutally attacked during a robbery    this doesn t upset melvin much     don t worry   you ll be back on your knees in no time     but when he is bullied into taking care of simon s dog   his life is turned topsy turvey    melvin is sequestered because he s afraid of what s out there on the other side of his apartment door    he has to make sure it s ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side    when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it   talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes    this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up    hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him   he pays for a specialist to treat her son    he even develops a friendship with simon    all three people are heavily damaged    melvin has retreated from life in his apartment    carol has devoted herself to her son   convinced that she has to give up her life for him    simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out    a more unlikely trio to form relationships   you d rarely see    and in the midst of it all   there are some wonderful moments    melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice       you make me want to be a better man     he tells her    one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up   he is still a curmudgeon    carol   afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him    it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t shirt contest    there s hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson    i don t remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over the edge melvin is no disappointment    nicholson may be the best actor working today    hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson s energy    she isn t afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top notch    their on screen chemistry is a bit odd    each does a wonderful job with the character   but together   there s something a little off    it s a minor problem   they do work well together   but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four star film    director james l   brooks     terms of endearment       broadcast news     has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful   nominees for all the top golden globes   winners from the national board of review   inevitable oscars   and has a winner on his hands       as good as it gets   isn t exactly the quality that the title says   but it s pretty darn close       michael redman has written this column for

316	0	since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993 s steven spielberg drama   schindler s list   and directed 1993 s intelligent   searching for bobby fischer     his new film     a civil action     should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career    what doesn t make sense is how such high profile and superb actors as john travolta   robert duvall   william h   macy   and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project   which is both dull and completely ineffective    the film   which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia   certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally charged   but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings   leaving us with nothing more than a poorly done courtroom drama    based on a book by jonathan hart   which was consequently based on a true account     a civil action   is set in 1982 in the town of woburn   mass     where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann   john travolta   decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children s death from leukemia due to unknown causes    jan originally decides to drop the case   but when he stumbles across to corporate giants   grace and beatrice foods   who have plants located near the families  homes   he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place   the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which   thus   goes into the city s drinking water    suddenly   after hearing about the families  heartbreak and personal stories   he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery   even though he is warned by his staff accountant   william h   macy   that no money is coming in to them   only going out    also figuring into the story is jerome facher   robert duvall     beatrice foods  corporate counsel   who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his  20 million offer to settle the case    coming from such a talented writer   director   and cast   not to mention one of the most interesting film composers   danny elfman     a civil action   is an astoundingly empty headed drama   one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience    perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture   zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning    watching the film   i couldn t help but notice its similarities with 1997 s far   far superior film   the sweet hereafter     which dealt with a lawyer   played brilliantly by ian holm   investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children    in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident   holm interviews the grieving parents   as well as the sole surviving passenger   a teenage girl   which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter   a young drug addict who has run away from home    not only was the plotting similar to   a civil action     but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes    considering this   it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful   a sweet hereafter   was   not only concentrating on the school bus accident   but delving deeply into ian holm s character and his own personal demons   as well as the teenage girl    in   a civil action     however   i have no idea where the running time went   since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness    we do not get to know the parents very well   nor any of the main characters    through its whole duration   i did not learn one thing  not one thing  about travolta s lawyer character   jan schlictmann   who doesn t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job    every scene is tediously related directly to the premise   and therefore   there was no one for me to care about or root for    you ve got to work pretty hard   actually   to not get an audience to become involved in the parents  plight   since their children are dead   but that is exactly what   a civil action   does    to be honest   i would be fairly hard pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked    aside from one flashback to when a man s young son died on the way to the doctor   i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes   and more than once found my mind wandering    i could say the performances were good   but who s fooling who    since every character is one dimensionally written   no one s acting abilities are challenged in any way    travolta plays a lawyer well enough   but that s about all he does    duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role   apparently only appearing to give one liners at every chance he gets    and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture s final scene   as a judge    she appears unbilled   since it is just a cameo   but why did she even agree to do it in the first place    finally   when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role   the film left me with another question   what was the point    abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum   where none came before that to begin with     a civil action   seemed to me   at least   to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama   and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with    
1676	1	look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future    some sort of decision had to be made   and   for better or worse   it irrevocably altered the course of your existence     from time to time   everyone thinks about the roads not taken   and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different    perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action    catching the 10 am train   for example    could have an equally profound   yet less obvious   impact    maybe that s where you met your significant other   and   had you reached the platform just a few seconds later    film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else   and that s why there s no shortage of movies about this subject    the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski   who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance    these themes weave their way through many of his movies   including decalogue   the double life of veronique   and the triptych of blue   white   and red    however   they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance   where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action   missing or catching a train   changes the course of his life    in his autobiography   kieslowski on kieslowski   the director describes his attraction to the concept this way      the idea is  rich and interesting   that every day we re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we re completely unaware      while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films   including   in a way   frank capra s it s a wonderful life     sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths    the   road not taken   approach isn t just a plot device   either    writer director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses catches a train    the audience watches   with ever growing fascination   how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life   her future career   where she lives   whom she loves   and whether she has a family    as her separate destinies diverge and then re converge   she becomes two completely different individuals    that woman is helen   played by gwyneth paltrow as a long   dark  haired brit    one day   after losing her job as an advertising executive   she decides to return home in the middle of the day    the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform    in scenario  1   she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station    on board   she meets the cheerful   talkative james   john hannah     a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty    minutes later   in her flat   she walks in on her lover   gerry   john lynch     in bed with another woman   jeanne tripplehorn      in scenario  2   she misses the train and   shortly thereafter   is the victim of an attempted mugging    she doesn t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry s infidelity    juxtaposed one against the other   while sharing many places   cues   and characters   the two stories proceed in parallel from there    on one level   for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate   sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience    but   for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting   a script with a few twists   and a great deal of genuinely funny material   sliding doors still fits the bill    one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences    those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures   and those who could care less    it shouldn t come as any surprise that the acting   at least from three of the four leads   is solid    paltrow   who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same   yet gradually become much different   is the standout    she plays both of her roles effectively and believably    the shy   insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated   platinum blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man    john hannah   known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral   is instantly likable    john lynch   taking a break from movies about ireland s troubles   does a good job presenting gerry as a inept   selfish philanderer    only jeanne tripplehorn   who plays an over the top vixen   seems out of place    her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring   and it s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element    one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice    douglas mcferran   who plays gerry s best friend   russell   is an absolute delight   stealing every scene that he s in    part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie    on one occasion   he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy    on another occasion   while laughing at gerry s plight with the women in his life   he comments     being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable      but it s not all in the dialogue    mcferran tears into this part with relish   his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top notch comedy    this is the first feature film for peter howitt   and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb    the script is shrewd and inventive   combining wit   romance   and intelligent melodrama into a crowd pleasing whole    sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies   however    for those who are so inclined   its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe    all while having a good time

451	0	i ve always been a kevin kline fan   silverado   fish called wanda   pirates of penzance   and even his hamlet on pbs  great performances    the minute i saw the trailer for this film   i resolved to see it    besides the fact that kline starred   it looked like a hilarious film    i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent   however   as i also thought     wow   if there s this much funny stuff in the trailer   there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film         oops   i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo   my name for our local multi multi plex      the film began          the film concerns an english drama teacher at a suburban high school   named howard brackett    he loves poetry and great literary works   but his class is more interested in his famous former student   played by matt dillon       i d put in his name   but my wife won t let me take notes during a movie and i ve forgotten it      they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him    brackett has been engaged to another teacher   played by joan cusack   for three years   and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her    the wedding   however   becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual    kline spends most of the first two thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn t    the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference    his closest friends don t help matters   bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party    there are some genuinely hilarous moments   one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity    kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck   who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out   while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations    the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding    kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows        if you want to be surprised   don t read   i am going to reveal the ending           instead of saying   i do   in front of his parents and most of the town   and even some cameras   he says   i m gay      this is where the movie   in my opinion falls apart    most of the humor in the film had come from kline s insistence that he was straight   while at the same time   loving poetry and being a senstivie guy   dressing well   and occaisionally acting prissy    it reminded me of the   effeminate heterosexual   sketch from saturday night live    it was funny   it was sustainably funny   and kline s performance made it doubly so    however   after the wedding   the film drags on    they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion   but it then gets into the serious side of what he s done    he reconciles with his parents and his friends   some of which had turned on him    there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time   the scene with his mother and her friends   which was hilarious   seemed pointless   and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless    finally   even though i am not catholic   i found the scene with the priest to be condescending    the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship   proclaiming to brackett in the third person     he s gay      it got a chuckle from the audience   but i was distracted by it   and began to tire of the film    by the time the wedding had come and gone   i found myself hoping it would be over soon       much like this review you are saying    overall   if i have to quantify it   i say   rising action gets         and climax and falling action gets    see it in economy time    
145	0	this is your definitive   hollywood   movie   extremely predictable   following the basic formula   a horrible ending     overzealous writing   meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting   therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space   and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise ass character   of which we ve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly   wasn t used enough here     i m afraid the film would have been completely unbearable    in this film   ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend    while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her    over money   how original      while in jail she works out   exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition    now she has learned about a law titled   double jeopardy   stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her   although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works      now her po   parole officer     and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims    skipping over to the acting   the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress   no offense   she has been good  simon birch  and even very good to great  kiss the girls  at times   in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better        but she s terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying   doesn t really add to the movie at all   just takes away    as i d said   jones was fine   although he did not have much to work with    he was much more of a supporting character    which is fine   and he handled it well   especially considering the material he had to work with    i feel this film had alot going for it    originality not being an issue    the acting was the only thing   as i said   keeping it alive    the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better    the action scenes were well made   however sometimes out of place      i was just left unsatisfied in the long run    so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over thought   the plot has certainly been done before   generally speaking     the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot   and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones   who if he had some more screentime   could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating   in my book   anyway    keep this in mind   if you re in the mood for a good action film    rent the fugitive    d   
741	0	when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy   the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass    toss out your usual objectivity   ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it   forget how unbearable it was to sit through   and find some meaningless way to compliment it    this   of course   will be of no service to your readers   but at least you ll avoid the hate mail from the movie s fans    thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina   not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot      directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love   she spent the last one third of her life on film   the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez    paulina was a maid in vicky s household when vicky was young    i got to learn the film s background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present    for those without such context   the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film    the acting is amateurish   the story is maudlin   and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie    grainy and overexposed   the movie   shot on 16mm film and videotape   has little to recommend it    confusingly composed   the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story    quite bloody at times   the story   full of horrific images   seems designed to shock and repulse us    why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8 year old paulina    another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her    in retaliation   she bites off part of his finger    this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood    the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner    one   for example   sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body    the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten    certainly she had to endure a miserable life    but that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good    i felt trapped in the theater watching it    only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable    paulina runs 1   28    the film is in spanish with english subtitles    it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers    
1332	1	one never quite knows what one is going to get with a mamet film    his american buffalo is a set bound piece that has very little plot    sometimes he will tell a story that really moves    heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work    unlike his the spanish prisoner   there are no lapses in credibility    heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games    it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double cross whom   and frequently it is mamet double crossing the viewer    watching the film s team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either   what the heck are they doing      or   why didn t anybody think of that before      appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job    it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay   now a regular actor in mamet films    this is a robbery that works like a well oiled machine    there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore   played by gene hackman   filmed on a security camera    now joe has to get out of the business    it was coming time anyway    joe s team including bobby blane   delroy lindo     fran moor   rebecca pidgeon     and pinky pincus   ricky jay   is going to split up and go separate ways    but crime boss bergman   danny devito   is pulling the strings and he says that joe and his people have to manage one more robbery    and he has to take along a young kid   the short  fused jimmy silk   sam rockwell      immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye    much of what distinguishes heist is mamet s dialog    remarkably it serves a double purpose    the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamet s special feel for dialog    hackman has lines like   everybody needs money    that s why they call it money      mamet s timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production    the plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent the score   which is   in fact   a very similar story    both are good films   perhaps for some of the same reasons    but at least on a high level they are much the same story    the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them    i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12   2001    that made the subject matter just a little too timely    my understanding is that the release will be delayed    my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeon s acting at times seems very poor    it is some kind of mamet trademark i do not understand to have women talk without inflection   as if they are just reading the words for the first time    it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller    it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high  2 on the  4 to  4 scale

1698	1	capsule   this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii   life in a japanese prison camp    to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity    the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone s taste        3    4 to  4    more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way    this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law    during world war ii   of course   the one goal was winning the war    this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal    when the japanese had captured prisoners   they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal    minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output    while the germans   not known for their kindness in those days   had a 6  mortality rate among captured prisoners of war   the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27     the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad    that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do    the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day    and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll    in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany    filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story   perhaps for fear of offending the japanese    there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps    certainly there was david lean s the bridge on the river kwai    there were some low budget british exploitation films and that was about it    then there were tv series   a town like alice   and   tenko      lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa    it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university    the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them    the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad    it turns out to be a grim joke   one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves    beating and torture are commonplace events    men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health   it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable    however   unlike as in kwai   the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital   called by the prisoners the death house    so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail laying machine    this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies    the japanese believe that the individual is nothing   that conformity to group s norms is all that gives a life meaning    conformity is purpose    before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp    if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story    if the british   with one american   by the way   and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story    it is neither    it is a stirring and believable account of camp life    the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow    this serves a double purpose for cunningham    it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat    it also creates a distancing effect    the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music    this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience    i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a  3 on the  4 to  4 scale    
1803	1	this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff s play   hospitality suite     its  about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention   whose chicago company has sent them to wichita   where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel   where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna   someone named dick fuller   who is the head of a big industrial corporation    he is someone they have never met before   but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account   it is their only reason for coming to the convention       the big kahuna   revels in salesmen talk among the three white christian males   two of them   larry   spacey   and phil   devito     who are veteran salesmen   having teamed together for the last twelve years   while bob   facinelli   is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department    these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna   as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite    the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job   and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life    the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why    what comes into question is their opinions on life and death   on god and morality   and on how they make a living    these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch    their dialogue is acerbic   witty   and analytical    following in the long tradition of salesmen films    from death of a salesman   the tin men   and glengarry glen ross   as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high    in this case   it is landing the big kahuna    they each are trying to see why he s on top and why they are chasing after him    what makes this film different than the others   is its blatant religious message   comparing orthodox religion to what they do   as both must sell their product    and how after each one s psyche is stripped clean by the other   there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each    the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna   but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen    larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life    bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ    his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in    bob is a baptist   who takes a very non questioning and literal attitude about religion    to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin   according to the way he reads the bible    when asked by larry why he married his wife   he seems puzzled and can t even say because he loves her   only that marriage is something sacred to him    the contrast in their personalities is stark    larry is all business   he simply wants to close the sale    he comes into the room pumped for the convention   using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman    he criticizes phil for being so placid   for getting such a small suite   for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp   and for being burned out    he tells him to go on a vacation    get a woman    while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change   now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife   after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long    he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in    he has always been a charmer   shaking everyone s hand   trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale    larry is more aggressive as a salesman   he is always a heart attack away from every big sale    in contrast   bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him    this is his first time for him on the road    when dick fuller doesn t arrive at the party the salesmen throw   larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering    when told that he spoke to the secretary   larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account    but when they start talking to bob   whom they forced to act as the bartender   they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus    bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards   and that he invited bob to attend    larry and phil can t fathom how bob didn t make a sales pitch    but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller s attention about their company s product as they sent him off to meet fuller   and will await his return in the hotel room    these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass    the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room   as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives    these three performers were outstanding   each understanding what their role called for   each coming through with a marvelous performance    the only problem with the film   is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience    but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics   give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see    
1312	1	i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set   unless i m watching a movie    i don t even have cable   so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching   the x files   every sunday night    it s the only show that s worth an hour of my time each week   though   since i don t watch reruns   i m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether      i am an avid fan of the show   and have been for about three years now    and i love gillian anderson    the x files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off    the film is like a two hour episode   except that there are a lot more special effects   the plot is thicker   and the resolution is more satisfying    this is a terrific film   both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it   i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment      i expected to like it more than any episode i ve seen   and my expectations were met    actually   the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices   but   thankfully   the makers managed to do it right    when the finale ended   the fbi branch known as the x files had been destroyed   and our heroes   mulder   david duchovny   and scully   gillian anderson   were left stripped of five years of hard work    the film picks up soon after   and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building    but wait   i m getting ahead of myself    the film actually opens in the ice age   about 32   000 years prior   during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien    the alien s blood infects them   fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer     and the story jumps into modern times   during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer    it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy   and mulder and scully uncover the cover up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi    soon   they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens    as i ve written before   it s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this   because everything needs to be a surprise    fans of the show will know what to expect   and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film    director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen   making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television    there are some truly suspenseful and well created scenes here   late in the film   when they re in the alien spacecraft   you ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema      the special effects are very good   and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic    what i find interesting is that the x files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story    our heroes are given subtle introductions   we re not expected to know them on the outset     and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn t required to understand the film    there are   of course   little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans   but i ll keep those as surprises    it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides   and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly    the series is strong for a lot of reasons    it s original   though it has many ties to   the twilight zone   and owes some homage to hitchcock     and impressively eerie for a television show    what really makes the series shine   however   are the actors    duchovny has so much presence   and is just a fun guy to watch    he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man    anderson is equally good   and paralyzingly beautiful   she s also a strong actress    both performers have acted in little more than their series   however   though i think they ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon    i enthusiastically recommend the x files   both for fans and non fans    1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters   and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry    it s an intelligent film   and takes you places that you might not have been   or   at least   might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar      the x files is impressive in concept   as well   fans of the series are likely to be highly critical   and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move    it s nice to see a risk pay off for a change    actually   it s nice to see a risk at all    
1829	1	it was only a matter of time before a dilbert esque office comedy hit the screens    however   rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams   office space is instead based on the work of another animator   mike judge   creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill    in his live action directoral debut   judge aptly spoofs corporate culture    the story is certainly not very involved   but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps    peter   ron livingston   is a programmer working at the initech corporation    every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before       in  other words   every day is the worst day in his entire life    he s stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors   all obsessed with administrative trivialities    he s smitten with joanna   jennifer aniston     a local waitress   but hasn t the guts to even introduce himself    everything has simply made him a complete   nervous wreck    but all of that changes when   after an unintentionally over effective visit to a hypnotherapist   peter loses all of his inhibitions    he realizes his lifelong dream   to do absolutely nothing    he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss   bill lumbergh   gary cole     doing whatever he feels like    peter s friends and co workers   samir   ajay naidu   and michael bolton   david herman         no    not that michael bolton   are perplexed by their friend s sudden change in attitude    but   they have larger things to worry about   rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing        as bleak as much of this sounds   let me assure you that office space is a comedy   and quite a funny one    although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip   office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life    each mundane detail   taken by itself   seems completely   regrettably   plausible    yet   when combined into a whole   the picture which results is absolutely surreal    ron livingston tackles his role straight faced   and becomes much funnier because of it    his character isn t simply being a clown lampooning around the office   but rather seems possessed by a zen like clarity    he is operating on a higher plane   where everything suddenly makes sense   and from this vantage point   he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life    anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy   or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life   will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film    in fact   in addition to being wildly humorous   the film may actually prove to be cathartic    the animated roots of office space show in the film s lack of complexity    most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk    one employee   milton   stephen root     is practically a flesh and blood cartoon    however   despite their simple nature   the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny    it s not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film   though the situations may seem exceedingly far fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are      the film is flimsy and absurd   but also very funny    
1875	1	in roger michell s romantic comedy notting hill   william thacker   hugh grant   leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it s name to the film s title    one day   american movie superstar anna scott   julia roberts   walks in to purchase a book on turkey    quickly enamored of each other   the two embark upon an on again   off again love affair replete with romance   humor   and the occasional lump in the throat    the film opens with a non verbal cue to anna s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress s appearances in films and at premieres   coming out of limousines   walking the red carpets and such    without words   this sequence gives us a background to her character    following   however   is a set up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives    i don t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film   and which never resurfaces after the movie s beginning   but there it is    if there were ever a clear case for   less is more     this would be it    the film is told nearly first person from william s point of view   as he is in every scene    by nature of this arrangement   we get a very definite sense of what he is all about   and his nice guy personality wins us over easily    in fact   much of notting hill s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis    a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey soaked apricots from his refrigerator    or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image    william assures her he wouldn t say a word   then adds     well   i ll probably tell myself now and then   but i d never believe it      great stuff    the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible    we re constantly exposed to william s thoughts   feelings   actions and desires   but don t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him    there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest   but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she s been thinking all the times in between    this   combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two   makes this hugh grant s film hands down    he gets the great scenes   look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna     the great lines   and gives an overall wonderful performance    julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film   ala sandra bullock in a time to kill   along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character s unpredictable behavior    anna doesn t get a lot of our compassion    this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance   much of it supplied by grant himself   but with considerable help from the supporting cast    most notable is rhys ifans as spike   william s eccentric roommate   who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh    hugh bonneville   emma chambers   james dreyfus   and gina mckee bring up the guard as william s friends and family   particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister s birthday dinner   and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst    it s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation    roger michell s use of visuals doesn t sweep us off our feet   but does give us more than your typical movie of this type    for example   there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass    whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying   eight months later     michell presents us with more interesting cues   such as william s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him    another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air    we re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so   but in this case   the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird s eye view of the ground below    music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film s scenes   and some of this might have been better toned down   but in other areas it works to full effect    it s kind of a mixed bag   but still fares better than many of today s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video    at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate    notting hill s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all time greatest film pairings   but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it    for a couple of hours   you should expect to laugh more than cry   and that s not so bad   now is it    
530	0	here s a rarity   a children s film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject   is there a god    done well   it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children s cinema    unfortunately   it isn t    with jumbled messages   and an unclear audience   wide awake was better left asleep    fifth grader joshua beal   joseph cross   is in the middle of a moral crisis    his beloved grandfather   robert loggia   has died   and joshua has begun a quest    he wants to find god   to discover why bad things happen    this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents   dana delany and denis leary     but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths    at his catholic school   his favorite teacher   sister terry   rosie o donnell     tries to give him guidance   but this is a journey he must make on his own    meanwhile   he is having the most momentous year of his life    he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave   timothy reifsnyder     he gets his first crush   and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey    it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be    on its surface   it appears to be a kid s film    however   it deals with serious issues   and is likely to be boring for today s instant gratification kids    and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience   wide awake asks serious questions   but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer    if there were a bit more meat in the story   adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie    the actors who might have created a great cast   o donnell   leary and delany   are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos    the nostalgic elements   best friend   favorite teacher   first crush   etc     have been done much better in other movies   and actually seem more like filler here    the film s strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua s relationship with his grandfather    they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie    maybe the film would have been better if   instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks   it were set entirely during joshua s last year with his grandpa    it certainly would have been more entertaining    wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment    it starts out with noble aspirations   but never delivers on its promise    parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions       that is if their kids aren t bored to death first    
1397	1	jake kasdan   son of one of the best screenwriters around   breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard to categorize detective story   part mystery   part comedy   part character study and part romance    for the most part   kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film    daryl zero   bill pullman   is a modern day sherlock holmes    the parallel is present down to his love of music   though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin     and his addiction to drugs   amphetamines   rather than morphine      he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces   the case about the man who lied about his age   or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes    however zero s observance of the fine art of detachment   though it makes him a brilliant private investigator   makes him somewhat of a self imposed outcast in society    he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr   watson   i mean steve arlo   ben stiller      arlo is not happy with his job    he is thrilled to be around zero s brilliance   but his bizarre behavior   and strange requests   are frustrating to the former lawyer    and they re even more so to his girlfriend   jess   angela featherstone     who is fed up that her boyfriend s boss means more to arlo than her    this is the situation when a new case comes knocking    gregory stark   ryan o neill   hires zero to find his lost keys    it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring   and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence    now   stark is being blackmailed   and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end    to solve this case   zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell    however   this is when he is vulnerable       and  this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic   gloria sullivan   kim dickens     who may be involved in the blackmail scheme    for the first time   zero has to question his own objectivity   as he finds his client less and less sympathetic    zero effect is weakest in its obviously   wacky   scenes depicting daryl zero s odd behavior    such scenes might be appropriate in an out and out satire   making zero an ace ventura ish character    however   there s a much meatier movie in here       it just takes a while to get out    that s not to say that there s not a place for humor in this film    in fact   some of the best scenes are ben stiller s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer    however   the over the top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film   and they aren t funny enough to stand on their own    once the investigation is underway   however   zero s brilliance really begins to shine    his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock s own    as the mystery begins to unfold   zero s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions   but never lose the viewer    zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well    zero s relationship with gloria is low key   but it hits all the right notes    however   we are always kept distant from gloria s character    she s given plenty of development   but we never understand what she is thinking    perhaps that may be intentional   to place the audience in zero s zone of detachment    but   on the whole   it is frustrating    bill pullman   when he s not spacing out   creates a vibrant character in daryl zero    there s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years   and it is shockingly moving       expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character   but one which fits in well    and   although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called   zero   seriously   it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name    although zero effect is a bit awkward in places   it is a strong debut for kasdan   and shows great promise

1346	1	do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs    do you    well   as this movie shows us   they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring    unfortunately   there s a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside   feeling sorry for ourselves    a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing   and janeane garafolo s character abby relates to it well    like a certain oversized teenage movie critic   she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive   and the men seem to be backing her up on that    meanwhile   her gorgeous neighbor nora   uma thurman        uma being the only woman s name worse than nora   attracts men like flies    as abby tells her     you burp and they think it s cute    you barf and they line up to hold your hair back      but nora s down on herself for being too shallow and superficial    we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby s talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound       oh come on   any idiot knows how to handle that problem      he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person    abby   though   knows her body doesn t match her personality and that she probably won t have a chance with him once he sees her    so she gives him nora s body description and stands him up    nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for a big favor    she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun   abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna    the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful   she s not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person   but he doesn t suspect anything   realizing he s not living in a   three s company   episode    the charade continues   with abby furthering the relationship over the phone   including a decidedly unnecessary phone sex masturbation sequence   and nora furthering it in person   while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man    like sleepless in seattle   this comedy romance is predictable all the way through   but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom    the truth about cats and dogs isn t quite as entertaining as i was expecting it to be   but it handles well a theme i could identify with    the thing is   i find janeane garafolo rather attractive    she s no uma but i m sure in real life she d have no problems attracting men    i   on the other hand   couldn t attract a man to save my life        and am rather proud of that fact    
543	0	they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie s poster     no sequel      scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor   and it is not because the wayans brothers   shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera   don t try    what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof    the first movie   an outrageous   low brow   savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer   succeeded because of its take no prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue   familiar and popular    in scary movie 2   the filmmakers take on the haunted house ghost story format which   if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill   did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series    scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist   featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn    of course split pea soup is the punch line   an overabundant amount   which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive    but this pre credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action   which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project    some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original   but they lack that take no prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque    scary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another   offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball   and the films what lies beneath and hannibal   features that only faired adequately at the box office     john woo s mission   impossible 2 and charlie s angels    it is as if the wayans and their team of writers   at least seven are credited   just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they d coalesce    they don t    while the pace of the original left you breathless   the sequel moves with the speed of an 18 wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road    you can almost hear the reels panting    scary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original   but it falls very short    it s a dissatisfying spectacle   a very weak sister of a very good movie    the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is    
1492	1	the thought provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of   leila     a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui   that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty year career to gain u   s   distribution   thanks to first run features    although unfamiliar with mehrjui s previous directing efforts   perhaps the reason for this is that   while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country   the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers    set in modern day iran     leila   begins on the birthday of the title character   leila hatami     after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband   reza   ali mosaffa      as leila and reza set off to visit his parents   and then hers   where a birthday celebration has been planned   things seem rosy for the couple on the outside   but for leila   life isn t quite as sweet    earlier   on that very same day   leila had gone to see her physician   and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child    when all of the conditions are ruled out   and leila passes up the possibility of adoption   reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her   and doesn t care at all about having children    nonetheless   leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby   which is the societal norm   and her self esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother in law   jamileh sheikhi     whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news   reza is her only son      bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and   in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition   she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with    leila hesitantly agrees   and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens  inadequacies   reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like   even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn t give her full blessing    there are no easy answers to be found within   leila     a film that thoughtfully examines the central character s unfortunate plight   as well as the inner workings of leila herself   told through matter of fact narration    almost completely taken over by her own shame   she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother in law s requests   even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman    maybe because   leila   is from iran   the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences   since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence    leila   however   is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily   but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy   no matter what the circumstances    one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza   who married only three months after their first meeting   but obviously love each other very deeply    it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful   and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible    although seemingly unimportant at first glance   an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing   nearly uncontrollably   actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half   as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another    ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday   and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her    these   small   moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn   outraging sequences in the latter half   in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road   and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman    left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage   foolishly unbeknownst to reza   leila prays each time that the date will not go well   so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer    refusing to stay over at her parent s house   the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman   and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency   leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart   as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below    despite her initial agreement to such a thing   leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza   whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him    sure   the whole second marriage was his mother s idea   but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children   then he could have still easily backed out   couldn t he    in the pivotal role of leila   who appears in every scene   leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable   injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength   unavoidable vulnerability   and utter despair    unlike most american films   in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences   hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words    every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa   as reza   a man who   i believe   does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife   but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else    for all of its strong aspects     leila   isn t a perfect film    on a technical level   i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed    and concerning the plot developments   the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before    mehrjui s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice   particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother in law   played memorably by jamileh sheikhi    despite these minor missteps     leila   is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york s cinema village   and then on may 21 in la    the thought provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales   and when the climax arrives   leila s self worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation   to which there is no return    it s difficult to not consider how leila s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided   had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila   the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme   was going through

154	0	there was probably a good reason that the warner bros   studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened    and   after seeing this piece of toxic waste   i now know why    this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago    fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god s country   somewhere in eastern kentucky    it s beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate   kris kristopherson   who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role      it turns out that he s filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit    seagal plays jack taggert   an aikido versed   fighting machine   who is an agent with the epa    no       not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa    it s the environmental protection agency    i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers    taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice    written by someone named jeb   i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships   banjo picking preachers   and dumb as nails rednecks    but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in    seagal s idea of a disguise is a long length  1000 leather jacket    but to get closer to the kinfolk   he will fix people s porches for free    that s another great epa asset   teaching agents how to fix porches    slow and plodding   this project is a total mess    the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige    here   his bravado basically turns into bullyness    townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued    fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever    and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes    the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony   gets behind the pulpit   and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment    but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping   kristopherson   meets up with seagal    kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away    seagal gallantly replies     i ll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth      i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background    this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal s righteousness and narcissistic arrogance    seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace   that of the enviro thriller   on deadly ground      however   the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this    still   i believe in preserving mother earth   so save your  5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity

1583	1	eyes wide shut isn t the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick s final film   but it is an impressive achievement   a mesmerizing   haunting   adult psychodrama about marriage   fidelity and sex    it s a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end   consistently exhibiting the auteur s trademark penchant for long   continuous takes   his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast   indeed   eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot   kubrick   a renowned perfectionist   reportedly held his cast   hostage   on the set for nearly a year      in an uncharacteristic maneuver   kubrick cast two big name stars in the lead roles   namely real life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman    they play bill and alice harford   a volatile couple who   during the course of a couple nights   ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other    he is an m   d     she s unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party    at the affair   they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else    when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman   after smoking a dash of weed   inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night    he   truthfully   says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with    they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story   evidently some time ago   she had a thing for a young naval officer    she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night    bill is jolted by alice s story and we anticipate his reaction   but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go   show his face   at the house of a just deceased patient    this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town    the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down    he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street    then   through a series of coincidences   he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic   and frankly   creepy   orgy takes place   with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other    erotic dread mounts as cruise   who s not supposed to be there   wonders the spacious halls watching the   action   until he is discovered to be an outsider    much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros   digitally edited the orgy scene    with the help of a computer   they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts   they can still be seen   just not in all their glory   in order to avoid the dreaded nc 17 rating    european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it    roger ebert calls the american version the   austin powers version     and many others have bashed the alterations    i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene s mystical atmosphere    the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks    this is an artful   distinctively gorgeous production   shot in dark   moody hues and featuring some elaborate   beautiful scenery    from the giant mansion used in the film s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford s apartment   this film is always a pleasure to look at    to boot   a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still    at the core   behind the graphic   controversial content and unappealing mood   this is a good natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity    it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic    it s something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship    at the end   it seems   bill s eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other   more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york    kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman    tom is completely convincing as dr   harford   a man who seems guided solely by destiny   with no control of the course his life will take    nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective   she s headed for an oscar nod    the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast   at the head of which is director cum thespian sidney pollock   enigmatic and articulate as harford s mysterious friend    eyes wide shut is not perfect   the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good  looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander    still   this is an important work from a great director   and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick s best it is a worthy final film   a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness       1999 eugene novikov  137

1957	1	cinematically speaking   gordon parks  original 1971  shaft  is not a great film    a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action   this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman s   black private dick that s a sex machine to all the chicks   to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking    yet nearly 30 years after its original release  and long after the genre it spawned     blaxploitation     died with that decade  the 1971  shaft  remains an extremely entertaining watch   never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness    the reason for this is the same one that explains the film s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african american audience   the title character of john shaft    while the fact that the strong   smart   virile   and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance   his broad based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race   he is comfortable   confident   and proud about who he is   and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass    this fact also explains why john singleton s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is    much like the film that started the franchise   this  shaft  s plot doesn t score points in the originality department   but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers    contrary to what has been reported over the past few months   this  shaft  is not a remake of the original film   but more of a sequel spinoff    the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels   1972 s  shaft s big score     and 1973 s  shaft in africa      richard roundtree   once again plays john shaft   who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city    however   the focus of the film lies on his same named nephew   samuel l   jackson     who   as the film begins   is a cop whose take no crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors    when a privileged young man named walter wade jr     christian bale   accused of a brutal   racially motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail   a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p   i    but that s easier said than done   for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez   jeffrey wright     a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri   toni collette     the only eyewitness to his crime    peoples  or   rather   wright is also the big obstacle in jackson s way toward commanding this film    peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time   and wright is insanely funny during these stages    however   he isn t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish   and peoples  eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable   which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo   who bowed out before filming      it s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson   who is his usual captivating   charismatic self here     but that s exactly what wright does  and makes it seem effortless    then again   with such a talented ensemble surrounding him   it is not too surprising that jackson s impressive star turn doesn t quite tower over the rest   he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co stars    bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in  american psycho    so it only follows that his performance as a similar   less exaggerated character would be spot on    collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened   conflicted diane    busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft s sidekick rasaan    registering not as strongly  but through no fault of their own  are vanessa williams   as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez   and a dismayingly underused roundtree   they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price   singleton   and shane salerno       jackson also has little to   do   in a sense   some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside   his shaft doesn t even have one sex scene      that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he s not really an action director    this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases    they move well   as does the film as a whole   and are reasonably exciting   it s just that there s nothing terribly inventive about them    these set pieces are functional in the way the script is   they work well enough   but they re unsurprising and conventional    but if there s anything that a  shaft  movie does well   it s make the familiar look cool  and this  shaft  keeps that tradition alive    from the slick title sequence  scored   of course   to isaac hayes  ever infectious oscar winning theme song   which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film  on   the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado    even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced   it feels necessary    style doesn t exactly make for a great film   but when it comes to  shaft    that s of little consequence    what matters above all else is having a good time   and the latest  shaft  should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha  shut your mouth    
1735	1	i was born in 1970   which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons   8 tracks and disco    however   since i was 17 years old i ve seen more than my share of adult films    i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i m not against pornogrpahy    i ve seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available    director paul thomas anderson s boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema   the mid to late 70s    this was the period when x rated movies were real movies   shot on film   shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics    this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films   films that attempted to tell a real story    one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how   like in an any other billion dollar industry   the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete    in this case   the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette    burt reynold s manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur   known as jack horner    horner s has a steady   family   of performers   some of whom live in his plush l   a   home    but in the world of porn   performers are a commodity   the fresher   the better    when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque   he decides to add him to his stable    it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his    as directed by anderson   the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door    boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l   a    s hardcore film scene    but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends    the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut    by the film s final image   what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams    boogie nights is not about sex    it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers    in fact   the film isn t really about pornography at all    pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub culture to find acceptance of who they are    the film goes to brilliant   often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world    yet   like in the lauded tarantino films   these people still have their own moral code   their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively    the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion    first stop   the den mother   julianne moore   in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son    second stop   the cuckold crewman   william h   macy   who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone   the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real life porn star nina hartley      but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams    eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it    with no real ambition of his own   he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame    his alcoholic mother   clearly dissatisfied with her own lot   abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house    horner introduces him to amber waves   moore   who immediately adopts him   a nuclear family is born    the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her   babies   provides some of the films most poignant scenes    clearly   she is not even fit to manage her own life   let alone nurture these lost children    but the need to love and be loved is so strong   they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to    even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family    then again   perhaps its not so different from real families at all    eddie adams   who later takes on the screen name   dirk diggler     is skillfully acted by former pop star   mark wahlberg    i say   former   pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job    this is bold and brave territory for such a young man    he pulls it off marvelously    wahlberg is a   big   bright star   with a big bright future    boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt   without the first amendment preachiness    its intimate studies of character make it the superior film    wahlberg s surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson s    but in my opinion   boogie nights   is not the best film of the year    i got the feeling that itus 2 1 2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance    still   if the subject matter of this film intimidates you   thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing   but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway       ya  know   kinda like disco    
1405	1	my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance   or a movie that we ve all seen a million times     two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins    this is exactly what happened in this movie   but fortunately   they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way    the movie starts with a quick   and i do mean quick   glance of two presidents russell kramer   jack lemmon   and matt douglas   james garner      william haney   dan aykroyd   and ted matthews   john heard   are the new president and vice president    there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago    he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead    this movie was exceptional for many reasons    one being that they found people   lemmon and garner   that have good chemisty together    they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly   one being a ladies man and one being the old man   i ll let you fiqure which is which      also   they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well    it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman   except then he was a congressman      experience counts for a lot      
1155	1	jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities   but whom you end up liking anyway    in as good as it gets   the character in question is melvin udall   a successful novelist with obsessive compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible   except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you know where    he s mean    i mean really mean    the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium    every day   melvin eats at the same cafe   sits at the same table   and gets served by the same waitress    you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance   when his waitress carol   helen hunt   tells him he can just go sit in another section   and all the other waitresses just cringe    one day   melvin makes a comment that goes to far   and carol   genuinely hurt   comes down on him like a ton of bricks    at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course   but is also the only person who can get to him   too    another person who often crosses melvin s sights is simon   greg kinnear     an artist who lives on melvin s floor    aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city   simon has the added benefit of being gay   making him a prime target    simon s friend frank   cuba gooding   jr       also gay   does not fare much better    when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment   he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital   and frank   who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor   intimidates melvin into watching after simon s dog while he convalesces    this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage    an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in   melvin gets to like the dog   and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin s softening up to the world around him    it doesn t happen overnight   but throughout the film   he bites his tongue here   cares a little there   and most miraculously   falls in love    one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others    he s traveling terra incognita here   and it shows    good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film   especially by nicholson and hunt    they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen    greg kinnear   who is becoming known for his supporting film roles   is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon    he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist   and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels    cuba gooding jr   performs with a hyped up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear   and comes through with a near constant comic performance    the screenplay   by mark andrus and james l   brooks   is clever   touching   and funny    the best part about it   however   is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting    melvin is a man we can t quite figure out   but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention    carol is a working woman living with her mother   trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem    simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers   but who is still not accepted by much of society    combined with the talent of the actors   these characters make the film    the one noticeable area where the film is lacking   however   is the absence of cuba gooding   jr   through the second half    his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary   but the film ends before his return   leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved    i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general   in addition to a part in the film s conclusion    there s one actor   who will probably not be recognized by any awards   but who contributes greatly to many of the movie s best scenes and who deserves mention    this is that little dog    he plays such a pivotal role to melvin s character development   actually serves to forward the plot   and has some absolutely scene stealing moments   that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal    award or no   however   when even the dog puts in a good performance   you know you ve got an outstanding movie

925	0	the first species was a moderately successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects   a few well  paced action sequences   and frequent views of model turned actress natasha henstridge sans clothing    however   it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel    and   considering the quality of species 2   it s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead    the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is    if you throw away the plot   which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence   logic   coherence   and consistency   species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience    of course   that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys   who   at least in theory   shouldn t be able to get into an   r    rated film   and connoisseurs of bad movies    there s enough blood   gore   simulated sex   and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring    this is a grade z exploitation flick that s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment    somewhere   someplace   i recall hearing species 2 described as   erotic      i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie   because he   or she   has a peculiar notion of eroticism    sure   there s a lot of sex and nudity   but it s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free   splattering blood and gore in all directions    anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater    i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge   and   to get the obvious question out of the way    yes   she does remove her top   but only once   and only briefly      although the character she played in the original species is dead   government scientists still have the dna   and   out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse   they decide to create another clone    this creature   dubbed   eve   by its creator   dr   laura baker   played by marg helgenberger   reprising her role     is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile    meanwhile   man has finally set foot on mars    a team of three   led by patrick ross   justin lazard     has traveled to the red planet   but when they return to earth   they bring something with them    ross has become a half human half alien hybrid   and he s soon mating like crazy   collecting the blood soaked children that are the result of each sex session    his intention is obviously world domination    standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film   preston lennox   michael madsen     and one of patrick s fellow astronauts   dennis gamble   mykelti williamson      but when patrick learns about eve   a female of his kind   there s no damping his ardor    i m not sure what the budget for species 2 was   but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors   as opposed to being diverted into the special effects      michael madsen and marg helgenberger   both back for a second round   are clearly on hand to do as little as they can   grab the money   and run    ditto for james cromwell   who plays patrick s father      underused   is too kind a word to describe his involvement     invisible   would be more like it      george dzundza gets to do a little scenery  chewing as an angry but inept general    meanwhile   justin lazard s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge s limited abilities look good by comparison    the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson   who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick    complete with cheesy special effects   bare breasts around every narrative corner   and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter   species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics    director peter medak   a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume   has added another forgettable title   but at least he appears to have had fun doing it   which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness    do i recommend the movie    absolutely not   but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo intellectual bad movies do    here s hoping there s no species 3

1782	1	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    the teaser trailers for my best friend s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope   it looked like the sort of goofy   light hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight   but little more   i d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often    it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend s wedding was such a success   a strong   bouyant romantic comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects   featuring a triumphant performance from ms   roberts    the heroine of my best friend s wedding is julianne potter   julia roberts     a successful new york restaurant critic   and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes   rupert everett   that years ago   she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex lover michael o neal   dermot mulroney     a sports writer   that if they both hadn t married by the time they reached 28   they had promised to marry each other    both julianne and michael are both single   of course   and when george inquires about michael s age   julianne realizes that he s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday   and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day    however   she finds herself even more distraught when michael s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace   cameron diaz     and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding   julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael   and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary    the setup for my best friend s wedding   then   is a fairly conventional one   and in many ways the film s storyline is formulaic   but only to a certain extent   the film was directed by p   j   hogan   whose first feature   muriel s wedding   had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly duckling story   and the same holds true for my best friend s wedding   which confidently combines traditional romantic comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour    the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr   hogan    for example   there s a heartfelt   emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film   with a trio of teenagers   inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks   harmonizing in the background    my best friend s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film   and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect   it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen s everyone says i love you   i d even assert it s a more successful one    my best friend s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well    in a typical romantic comedy   kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty   conniving ice queen   and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps   this film is smarter than that   here   kimmy is sweet   sincere   and innocent   julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy s life   she d actually like her too    the george character is almost a staple of recent film   the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason   but in my best friend s wedding   he gets to have a playful   mischievous and charming personality    throughout the film   the formulaisms one often sees is romantic comedy are given little twists   and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion    there is a lot of smart writing in the well paced screenplay by ronald bass   we re given four interesting   vivid   and likeable characters   with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments    my best friend s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts   who turns in a top notch   confident and reassured performance as julianne    this isn t the sort of role one usually associates with ms   roberts   the julianne character s neurotic   fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role   but ms   roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here   remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience   if not entirely sympathetic   even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable    even better than ms   roberts though is cameron diaz   who turns in a shining performance in my best friend s weddding    with a smile which lights up the screen   she effectively conveys kimmy s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner   and never hits a false note in the film    she even sings   i won t soon forget her charming serenade of   i just don t know what to do with myself      rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george   and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film    his george is a bit of a devilish rogue   entirely affable   and mr   everett s performance is a delight to watch   he s clearly having fun   and his joy is infectuous    dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role   unlike the other characters in the film   he s not given a lot to do   but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms   roberts and mr   mulroney   and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic    when julia roberts  lustre began to fade   and she was usurped from her title as   america s sweetheart   by sandra bullock   i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile    while that didn t quite work out   it s near certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990   the romantic comedy   will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game    my best friend s wedding marks a return to form for ms   roberts   and cements p   j   hogan s reputation as a skilled director of comedy    
701	0	okay   i just don t know why   but i seem to be getting this diversion to disney made real life actors movies       as  well as real life acting tim allen movies    i couldn t even make it through   the santa clause     so why did i even see this       just to make an idle point   i did like   toy story     but that was good   also   i have this aversion to bad french farces   and if they remake them into american films    well   this is my excuse   it was prom night   i m not a prom person   my best friend and i impulsively went to the drive ins where they were playing   grosse pointe blank     wouldn t mind seeing it again   but i had to suffer through this first    i agreed to go    ugh    in all fairness   i can say that at least this inane plot wasn t dreamed by an american    it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of   little indian   big city     french title     un indien dans la ville        i stayed away from it like it was limburgher   and according to roger ebert   that was a good idea    but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement    the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage    let me clarify   his wife   jobeth williams   left him years ago   and i mean years   around 13 or so   and went to an island in the carribean or something    he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this       thing     played with an emphasis on over done by lolita davidovitch   who is usually good      she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off    he meets him   he has a weird name   mimi seku   i think       or  as the bad joke goes     mitsubishi     laugh track cue     he knows english   they fish   more bad jokes   pirhanna joke   the kid has a pet spider   he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty       you  know the drill    now this is where the plot complicates   well   complicates for this one   at least     the fish out of water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city    tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasn t able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is   martin short    a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere   how come in every hokey french import   there is a mob        tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries    the story is crap   the jokes are hokey and not really funny   and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting    but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn t help it    the whole time   i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this    at the end of filming   did they all scream out     we ve made a great movie   guys      i sure hope not    big question to get from this film   why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they re just going to do it the exact same way    huh    my   for some of the actors  names and a joke or two that made me chuckle   i guess       okay    so i really feel bad for it   so i only gave it one star    
1472	1	   love is the devil   is a challenging film   munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot   perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist s psyche rather than the artist s lifeline    watching it   i was enthralled with the look of the film   the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre   personalized filter    everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon   the film s subject   looked at it personally    but while i was engrossed   i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film   awakened from my trance by some inner distraction   and began to try and follow what s going on    exactly what was i looking at    watching this film   i wasn t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous    directed   and written   by john maybury     love is the devil   is stylish masterpiece for the senses    everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing    the camera angles are ferociously askew   and the close ups are uncomfortably too close    the editing is deft   occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds   but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs   or rather   intruders to bacon s world and psyche    as such   there is no real story    i ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn t read prior to the film   but what i learned was this   he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s   drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like    he was one of the first to really come out of the closet   and in interviews   he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty    as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi   he s like a foppish and self absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero    he lives life the way he wants to live it   to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him    it s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself     champagne for my real friends   and pain for my sham friends     he says one night at the bar he frequents         love is the devil   chronicles the latter part of his life    bacon   well known in his mid life   awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor    he walks in   unafraid of what he finds   and discovers a thief   george dyer   daniel craig      bacon gives him an offer   if he spends the night with him   he can take anything he wants in the morning    george agrees to this   and off to bed he goes   but ends up staying with him   for whatever reason    the film shows their lives together   at least in reference to one another    while creating bacon s world of friends   like   high art     this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood     the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant    bacon is haughty and bizarre   george is simple and doesn t understand bacon in the least   especially not his paintings    while watching this   that s basically all i thought was there    the film has a hypnotic feel   free of any restraints of form   and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about    once the film is over   it s easier to piece it together    i kept on thinking about this film   wondering what the point to all of it was    someone doesn t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all   and if they do   they do it by accident   but still allow some substance to creep in    thinking about it   i remembered how the two fed off of eachother    i thought about how bacon was a masochist   in love with cruelty   in one scene   he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight   and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer s head splashes across his face   in another scene   he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein s   battleship potemkin       and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain    he drove him over the edge   and for him that was love   even if it wasn t for george    i guess that explains the title    a bit    that s great and all   but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning    i wish it hadn t reduced itself to making some point about humanity   about how love is the most selfish thing in the world   and it is   if you look at it a certain way      or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man s twisted pysche    it s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience s throat    that way you don t reduce your film to something it s just not    i can t say i totally enjoyed   love is the devil     though    despite all of the things i respect about this movie   it s still rather uncomfortable to sit through    even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes   the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through   especially after an exhausting first hour    though hypnotic   it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times   as if it were taking advantage of one man s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it    as such   i respect the way the film looks    it s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that   along with   what dreams may come   and   dark city     it s the year s most visually stunning film    in fact   if a better script had been forged   i d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film   complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever    and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi   it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs    i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance    then i would have had something to hold me over even now    
1164	1	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    on december 20   1996   amidst all the year end oscar bait releases from the major studios   miramax s genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream    although the teen horror market had been given up for all but dead in recent years   the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns   eventually topping  100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history   while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre    the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry    suddenly   everybody was looking for hip   inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes    the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost    scream director wes craven   previously best known as the creator of new line s a nightmare on elm street film series   was thrust back into the limelight    and scream s rookie scribe   kevin williamson   burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion    it s hard to understate this last point    mr   williamson has   based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing   scream   i know what you did last summer from october 1997   and now scream 2     enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame   quickly become the most well known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly reading   box office figure watching youth culture since    well   since that quentin tarantino guy   whom   it is said   has also achieved some renown as a director      indeed   in a singularly freakish oddity   it is the screenwriter   mr   williamson   and not the director that has been receiving the lion s share of acclaim for the success of scream   and the print advertisements for scream 2 s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence   while the traditional   a film by wes craven   drapes the film s title in the ads   right below it   in equal sized font   yet   reads   written by kevin williamson     an affirmation of the screenwriter s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented       i can envision the board of wga   licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of   a film by   is attained      and   much like mr   tarantino s screenwriting   mr   williamson s work is vaguely unconventional   incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters    in scream   they satirically discussed other horror films   here in the sequel   the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels    scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood   and mr   williamson s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel    while the sequel was planned from the outset    a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr   williamson sold the screenplay for scream    the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived   and it s only at about the film s midway point when it becomes engaging    like its predecessor   scream 2 opens with a splashy   eye grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film s principal narrative   this time around   we re following the exploits of a young couple   jada pinkett and omar epps   attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab   a running film within a film gag where the   true life   events behind the first film has been turned into a movie      however   although it tries hard and has some good ideas    the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with   and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes    the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore   where her performance not only convinced me that she   could   act   but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i ve ever seen      there are too many knowing   hip pop culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence   and the setup isn t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream s   while the first film s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying   the payoff here is almost campily theatrical    flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college   where returning characters sidney   neve campbell   and randy   jamie kennedy   have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film    the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors    single minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers   courteney cox   roars into town to cover the breaking story   while ever awkward former deputy dewey riley   david arquette   flies in to protectively guard over sidney    they re joined by cotton weary   liev schreiber     who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film   his role here is significantly expanded    the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory   although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn t necessary    not because so many people have seen the first installment   but because this is   after all   a sequel to a slasher film   what do you   think   happened to these characters in the prior movie    there s a lot of new faces on the scene too   sidney s new boyfriend   derek   jerry o connell   and her new roommate hallie   elise neal     randy s fellow film student mickey   timothy olyphant     gale s newly assigned nervous cameraman joel   duane martin     omnipresent local journalist debbie salt   laurie metcalf     co ed cici cooper   ms   buffy herself   sarah michelle gellar     and a pair of simpering sorority sisters   rebecca gayheart and sirens  portia di rossi      any of these characters could be the killer    or for that matter   could be the next victim    as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay   the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly flimsy premise of a whodunit    one problem that scream didn t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer    here   and to some extent in i know what you did last summer     mr   williamson s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery    the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements       it doesn t help matters any that the killer s alter ego is fairly obvious from the get go      indeed   the finale plays as full out camp when the villain is finally unmasked   frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes    this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations   scheming   and motivation   that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it    while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived   the aspect where it s head and shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences    they re staged much more imaginatively here   save for the first post prologue murder   which is handled in such a mediocre   conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized     and are much more fun to watch    it s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck   and a cat and mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged   although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown    in terms of its characters   the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey   who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music      their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour    an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well written    and there s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed    on the other hand   sidney is pretty dull here    she doesn t have any compelling presence   and there s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she s the returning heroine    given this   and the fact that there s no strong second banana character for sidney   elise neal s role isn t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan s shoes     it s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film    what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast    the film s mounting body count bears out the fact that   no   character is safe   well     almost       while in principal i applaud this bold policy   at some point you ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel       i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular   whose casting for the next installment of the series would ve seemed obvious      but hey   as rose mcgowan s character said in the first film     no   please don t kill me   mr   ghostface    i want to be in the sequel      look what that got her    
1505	1	there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have   but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason       good will hunting   is about one of those people    the will hunting of the   horrible   title   let s face it   this film would be a bitch to title     played by co writer matt damon   is a mathematical genius    he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino    and he works at mit       as the janitor    one day   the professor of one of the most challenging courses   proffessor lambeau     breaking the waves    s stellan skarsg   rd     puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete    the next day   it s already done on the board   but no one in his class claims to have done it    so lambeau puts another problem on the board   this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove    and   duh   it s done again    of course   they catch the guy who did it red handed   will    before lambeau can find will again   he ran away when he caught him     will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court   and struck a police officer   so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements   a   he work with him on math   and b   he get some therapy    after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another   for a hypnotist   he fakes being under his spell   then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic     afternoon delight        finally   lambeau s old college roomate   sean mcguire   robin williams     a psych professor   agrees to treat him   and the two begin a rocky relationship   as sean tries to get will to open up    turns out will had a rough childhood   being abandoned   and placed in foster homes and what not    it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life   he wants a challenge    and that is to hang out with his buds   including the other co writer   ben affleck     and do honorable jobs   like construction    is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky    should this guy be forced to do something he doesn t want to do    this appears to be one of the million questions in this film   which is jam packed with greatness   but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should    i m not saying   good will hunting   is a bad film at all    it s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments   and lots of great things about it    the acting is amazing   with two oscar nomination worthy performances from damon and williams   who have amazing chemistry together    we also get some great support from stellan skarsg   rd   great name     ben affleck   and from minnie driver   who plays will s love interest   skylar    there are tons of individual moments that i adored    i loved all the comedy in the film   especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks   his various attempts at therapy   and of course   my favorite scene in the entire film   the one where he delivers a long   exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them    i liked the relationship between some of the people   like will and skylar   will and sean   sean and lambeau   and will and his friends    there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch    and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal   that i felt rightfully uncomfortable    like the break up scene between will and skylar   will and sean s first meeting   a bar scene between sean and lambeau   and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn t regret meeting his first wife   who would later suffer a slow   painful death   and leave him lonely and slightly bitter    however   the main flaw of the film is there s too much of everything   and not enough of it either    the film tries for deeper relations between the characters   but they re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten    take for example the relationship between sean and will   the film gets an interesting father son as well as doctor patient relationship going with out any problems   but when it tries to show them as equals   it falls on its face    we hear how they went to the same town   and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times    but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do    also   will s relationship with his best friend   chuckie   affleck     has a nice climax   but not enough rising action    we see them joking around   but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them   it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one    their relationship never goes beyond   just best friends     and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more       human    maybe it was just me    and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau   but that   again   is underwritten    and   of course   as in most films like this   the girl boy relationship is pretty underwritten    we never understand what they see in each other   so when skylar confesses that she loves him   it seems more like it s there for plot details that anything else    minnie driver is interesting   though   and breathes life into her character    the writing is a bit at fault here   but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness    sure   it feels overstuffed   but it s extremely enjoyable    the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh   and seems extremely human    i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue   which is amazing    while this is probably director gus van sant s most conservative film   you d hardly know it s the same director of   to die for     the only van sant film i ve seen   really     it s still a pretty remarkable film   albeit a tad overrated   what s this   best picture   deal        and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws   i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone    
1693	1	field of dreams almost defies description    although it s about baseball   it s not a baseball movie    although the film is extremely spiritual   it s not about religion    and although field of dreams is melodramatic   it s not a tearjerker    to really understand what field of dreams is all about   you have to see it    in the film   kevin costner plays ray kinsella   a baseball fan    60s berkeley graduate   and iowa farmer    one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields   ray hears a voice   it tells him     if you build it   he will come      then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn   shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again    and even though it depletes his family s savings and his neighbors think he s crazy   ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field   complete with bleachers and flood lights       if you build it   he will come      and lo and behold   shoeless joe does come  bringing with him several of his dead teammates    and then ray hears the voice again   it tells him to   ease his pain      ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann   an influential and radical novelist from the  60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society    with great aplomb   james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey    the cast in field of dreams is excellent   especially kevin costner in the lead role    costner gives a quiet   subtle   and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life    costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale    amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray s feisty and loving wife   who against her better judgement supports her husband s crazy ideas    in her most impressive scene   madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p   t   a    meeting   displaying the sincere passion of a  60s berkeley radical    ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe   the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago   black sox   scandal    and finally   burt lancaster is memorable in a small   but important   role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning    field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life   wonder   mystery   spirit   and humor    it   for the most part   succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief    ray kinsella s spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous    but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama   it unfortunately does at times go overboard   and by the end it gets down right sappy    in general   however   field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy  one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics    
222	0	at the outset of swordfish   john travolta s gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today    basically   he says   it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers    how ironic   as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture    swordfish is loud   violent and amoral    it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life    and how does travolta s gabriel plan to do this    by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out terrorize terrorists    swordfish is a very cynical movie    it relies on an audience s perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non human   faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration    the movie s plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down   you d actually see how ridiculous it all is    this is a live action road runner cartoon   moving so quickly that it s over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions    the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson   hugh jackman     recruited by gabriel to crack the government s computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti terrorist campaign    talk about whacked out patriotism    my objections to swordfish are many    the body count is high   but that is expected in a movie of this sort    it s becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers   police officers and government agents blown to bits    another example is the family dynamics between stanley   his 10 year old daughter and his ex wife    stanley   though having served time in prison for hacking   is shown as a loving and caring father   forbidden by his ex to see his little girl    audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband s adult films    thus when she is found murdered late in the movie   neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve    in fact   subconsciously   many in the audience are probably glad she was killed    then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel s henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley s daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel    children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich   in recent films    there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on screen victims as well    yea   it s only make believe   but that doesn t mean you have to tolerate it    travolta is cool   deadly charming and flamboyant as the near crazy gabriel    his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face off    jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings    his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database    his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate    halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel s assistant   while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel    swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger than life character in gabriel    viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain    and maybe that is the movie s underlying flaw   there is no real hero to speak of   only those doing their upmost to survive    and that is not enough    this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water    
638	0	200 cigarettes takes place on new year s eve 1981    monica   played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year s party    everyone in town is trying to get there   but some are caught up in other things    this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes    as we meet the characters headed towards the party   we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal   and not interesting at all    this disappointed me greatly    the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion    lucy   played by courtney love   is with kevin   played by paul rudd    the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship   but starts to blossom into something more than that    this subplot is extremely boring and dull   and i am getting quite sick of plots like that    janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot   dealing with kevin    she plays ellie   an ex girlfriend of kevin s    this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo s talent    there was no point to it at all   and it was hardly even in the movie    when lucy runs into a bartender   played by ben affleck   another subplot is formed    the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica s party    at the bar   he runs into two more girls    the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker   but unfortunately   due to the terrible acting of both of them   i don t even remember their characters names    ben affleck is a good actor   but his character doesn t go anywhere so he doesn t have much screen time to give a good performance    featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles   and they are part of the reason the film is so bad    christina ricci plays val   and gaby hoffman plays stephie    the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost    they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night    this subplot was alright   but it was quite annoying with stephie s accent    hoffman did an okay job of acting   but ricci did good    she was underused   considering she is such a wonderful actress    another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy   played by goldie hawn s daughter   and jack   played by jay mohr    jack is an actor who doesn t care about the girls he goes out with   he just likes dates for one night   and the next day he doesn t    kate hudson is a huge klutz    she gets herself into very funny situations   that are the funniest parts in the entire movie    they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well    this subplot could have been used more   mainly due to hudson s performance    mohr wasn t good   but he wasn t bad    he was just alright   which i didn t find acceptable    there is not much to say about the performances in the film    none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not    the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci s as always good performance   kate hudson s funny role   courtney love s mediocre performance   and paul rudd s annoying and overused performance    i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr   ben affleck   casey affleck   gaby hoffman   dave chapelle   and especially out of janeane garofalo    the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes    martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981    the soundtrack is full of 1980 s tunes   ranging from   i want candy   to   tainted love      the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s    during the film   i often found myself asking the questions     is there a reason to this    is there any moral story    is there a point    are any of the events going on in the film necessary    do i care what lucy and kevin are going through      the movie is extremely boring   and by the time they reached eleven o clock   one hour before midnight   i could not wait for the movie to be over    the plot is okay   but the subplots make it terrible    maybe if the film was about the party   not about the people at the party   it could have been a lot better    the bottom line   just like a slasher movie   this   80s comedy is just one too many    
1285	1	trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda   the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter    the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60 s   then cut to the harsh reality of the present    sheffield has become some sort of a semi slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel factories   a once flourishing industry    gaz   carlyle   spends most of his time in the worker s club   a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers    he and his  plump  friend dave   addy   as well as their former foreman gerald   wilkinson   have been sitting around the club for months without any  call for duty     what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child support money to his ex wife    suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son   he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild idea to get the money he desperately requires    dave and gerald too have problems of their own    on top of his lack of employment   dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his plump  appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months   leaving home for  work  when he was actually a long standing member of the worker s club    there we have it   people with real problems and a not so practical solution for them    gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag   to perform a strip act at the local pub    in gaz s own words while looking at an add for a strip act featuring hunky  beautiful  men    if women are willing to pay for this   they sure as well will pay for real men     the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all    it is a small film which delves in the harsh reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to    it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human factor going for it    never for once   was it trying to be manipulative at all   the full monty was true to itself all the way    while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high   audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh   something lacking in many comedy films   wannabes     from hollywood    other than carlyle   who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting   the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on screen    however   the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying    carlyle s work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting   implying real acting skill and flexibility on screen    kudos to the people involved in this film   especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just another striptease    already a critical and financial success for such a small film   the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout    while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way   the full monty gives one the same satisfaction       in  half the time    
1136	1	   stuart little   is one of the best family films to come out this year    it s a cute   funny and very good natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords    though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about   i do know that this film does not disappoint    finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be   with a few surprising twists   some very funny moments   and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie    stuart little is a mouse    he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption   he now lives with the littles    a nice little   no pun intended   family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city    they have a little boy george   played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki   and now they have a new son    at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat    george doesn t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first   but once the two play together they instantly bond    stuart however is missing something   and he wants to know who his real parents are    the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back    hesitating the littles know what s best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat   he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart s past ending up to a sentimental and very heart warming ending    one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects    just like in   star wars   episode 1  the phantom menace   stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real    from the detail of their fur   to the detail of the way the walk   the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this  90 million dollar film and it shows    another movie that this has in common with is   babe   with it s talking animals and people understanding them    it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids    michael j   fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the   homeward bound   movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could    he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable    another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball    when he was timon in 1994 s   the lion king   i would have sworn he was a comedian   and now in   stuart little   he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike    for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well    she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr   little    both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996 s   jerry maguire      even though stuart little is completely cgi   the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other       stuart little   is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter    we get entertainment   laughs   cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie    its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see    even though it has a  90 million dollar budget i m sure it will make over that or just below it respectively    for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie   i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know   stuart little   and   toy story 2   are by far the best family films this year    a winner      
231	0	it s amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand up around but completely fall flat in the movies    take adam sandler    on the basis of his first two cds     they re all gonna laugh at you      and   what the hell happened to me          he s the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams    but when you put him in front of a camera   it just isn t the same    i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation   but his latest film   the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal    seriously   i m willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here    in fact   i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic    the first half hour generated not one smile in me   with it s scenes of emotional abuse towards adam s character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players   but also by his very disturbed mother   kathy bates   what is the world coming to        granted   after the film gets rolling   there are a few mild chuckles throughout   i m even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice     but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it s nearly hour and a half running time    you re all familiar with the plot because you ve seen it at least a million times before   everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions   in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves    and believe me   i m not giving anything away by saying that sandler s team wins    if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie   then god be with you    the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby s love interest    i mean   they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose   but they do extremely well with what they are given here    kudos to both of them    my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin   who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen    rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh    or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have   like jim carrey did with the recent truman show    with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses   he just can t keep going on like this    
1205	1	he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment   raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother    she inspires his love and his fear   and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus    he has a rudimentary grasp of language   mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother s phrases    he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous   his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door    he is 35 years old in body   but a child in mind and spirit    he is the premise for bad boy bubby   a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby   nicholas hope   who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment   etc     etc   then one day his father   ralph cotterill   appears    his father is a shabby down at heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion    unsurprisingly   he is not thrilled with the way   his   boy has turned out    he is   however   rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother   claire benito     and   more to the point   her ample breasts    soon they are copulating on the dingy couch   while bubby crouches   confused   in the next room   acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest    bubby s relationship to the world may be warped   but it is at least stable    the father s arrival disturbs his precarious balance   causing an oedipal conflict which ends  freud would be pleased  in violence and   as a result   freedom    bubby intuits from his father s arrival that the air outside is breathable   he leaves the apartment   his past   his world   behind    so far   so good    the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby   which bring us to this point   are quite brilliant    the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby s hermetic two room universe    it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise   bubby is used by his mother for sex   he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane   he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins    it is grim and savage and appalling   but also strangely tender  de heer   having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby s   does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes   but simply empathizes    he observes what it might be like    the intensity of these opening scenes   with their minimalist mise en scene   immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world   and owes much to david lynch s eraserhead   not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack    for thirty minutes   the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own    then de heer lets bubby out   brings him into contact with our world   and the film never quite recovers    our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide   where he wanders the streets and meets people   where he suffers and learns and survives    he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band   how an anti social half wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages   wisely     he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress   he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach   he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group   he is imprisoned and raped   he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension   he is loved by a motherly large breasted nurse   carmel johnson              it goes on   by turns inventive   silly   tasteless   endearing   and sometimes all of these things at once    de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world   the tone shifts   uneasily   from fable to realism to satire and back again    the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest   the film is best understood as a kind of parable   and   indeed   the religious implications of bubby s experiences are foregrounded   icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother s walls   bubby dons a priest s collar stolen from his father   a church organ playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief   the woman who redeems him is named angel    the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby s mind   do not fragment him into psychosis   rather   the world accomodates him   and heals him    although de heer s touch is at times overbearing   bubby s salvation is touching   what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na   ve humanist tale of improbable hope    a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community    he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman   turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art   and turning the band into a popular draw    innocence triumphs    bubby becomes a holy fool   an idiot savant   and graces us with wisdom    it s a strange turn of events   but by now we shouldn t be surprised   because bad boy bubby ain t like other movies    
1937	1	when i initially set out to review this film   my tag line was going to be   you too can believe whales can fly      then it was going to be   you too can believe pastel triangles can fly      then   it was going to be   you too can believe wood sprites can fly      finally   i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say        there s a lot of flying going on in this film    as our first host steve martin tells us   the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in    well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while   because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released    part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940   grossing somewhere close to  110   000 in its original month of release      subsequent re releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved   and rightfully deserved      to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia   disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before   six stories high    in an exclusive four month engagement   from january 1st to april 30th   2000     fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us    after the engagement is over   the film will be shown at regular theaters    is the format effective for the film    with a few exceptions   yes    the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven s fifth symphony    it s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about   but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily    everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil   black bat like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts    eventually   shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat like things and peace returns to the butterfly things    though this segment isn t very story driven   some of the images are very visually strong   especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things   who are all outlined in blood red colors   begin to overtake the skies    the next segment is set to ottorino respighi s   the pines of rome      in this segment   some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape    a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack    he is finally saved   by another liberating shaft of light   and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the   oceans   of clouds    again   visuals are the key with this segment   especially where the whales are involved    reportedly the whales   as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences   are shown as actual size    the cgi whales look incredibly life like   except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images    one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent    absolutely beautiful stuff    the third segment   and the least of the eight segments   is set to george gershwin s   rhapsody in blue      this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld   and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york    there s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer   an out of work sad sack that dreams of having a job   a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm   and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife    i won t go into how everything works out   but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending    unfortunately   the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments    segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich s   piano concerto no   2   and is an animated version of hans christian andersen s   the steadfast tin soldier      a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind up clock ballerina   whom he assumes is also one legged because he can t see her other leg extended out behind her     much to the dismay of an evil jack in the box jester    the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina    little does the jester know   the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from    the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl    although the ending has been altered from the andersen story     the steadfast tin soldier   is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short    some children may find the jester to be a little frightening   but otherwise the segment is well made    segment five is the funniest of the bunch    set to camille saint saens   the carnival of the animals     this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number    while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia   it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy    segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia   and it s the one that people remember most     the sorcerer s apprentice      the story is the most recognizable   so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo    unfortunately   the segment wasn t made to be presented on large format film   considering it was shot full frame   and exhibits large amounts of grain    there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain    similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately   but no one seems to notice for some strange reason     an anomaly common to many 18 plus screen theaters    segment seven is set to sir edward elgar s   pomp and circumstance march no   1   and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character    donald duck   stars   as an assistant to noah   whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark    during the loading   donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn t make it on the boat    they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners    despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece   it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear jerkers foisted on audiences these days    powerful stuff    segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich     saving the best for last      set to igor stravinsky s   the firebird     an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape    trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation    when the sprite examines the formation   it awakens and becomes the titular firebird    in a stunning spectacle   the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path   including everything that the sprite has worked to create    some amazing animation is present here   and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone   although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film      the host segments are largely   no pun intended   throwaways   although steve martin s clip is pretty funny    be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin    penn and teller are usually funny   but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting    the best segment comes from   of all people   bette midler   who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board    pieces like flight of the bumblebee   a take on the four horsemen set to wagner s   ride of the valkyries     and a strange segment prepared in the  40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments    for fans of visual stimulation or classical music   fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon    the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material    as i mentioned earlier in the review   if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film   fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters    i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though    then you too can believe that whales triangle things sprites can fly     g   
1125	1	andrew lloyd webber s musicals   preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice   present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time    webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as   oklahoma       or the slapstickness of shows like   a funny thing happened on the way to the forum      they instead tackle hot issues from our past   and view them differently   and pack them together with redundant   catchy music   as well as thoughtful lyrics    like   jesus christ superstar     which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective   in the cool tune   superstar     a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn t spread his message wider       evita   takes an inventive stance on its topic   this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator   juan per   n   eva   who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention   much like the woman playing her   madonna   although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent   among other things         evita   deals with the rise and fall of eva per   n   a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan   jonathan pryce     then died at the young age of 33   creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di   the two do share a bit in common   although it wasn t like di slept to   the top        webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals   but they always have a point for doing it    here   they wish to expose her for what she is   but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks   her lying   and covering up for her fascist husband   but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions   and her death was very sad    it s also a musical   with almost no words not unsung    the film plays like a rock opera   much like their   jesus christ superstar     with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals   even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics   which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience   but also a very entertaining one    after all   this is a musical   and webber s musicals never undermine this    they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth   walking on a fine line between the both   and never stumbling on either side    this is why the beginning of   evita   is kind of a let down    okay   it is a let down    i m not saying the opening moments are bad   because they re pretty good    but what comes after is a lifeless   un entertaining   and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer   jimmy nail   into taking eva to buenos aires after a one night stand    in the musical   it s a fun   energetic sequence   culiminating in the show stopper     buenos aires     which is also lifeless    then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer   instead of her leaving him   where she ends up singing the sad tune     another suitcase in another hall     which was meant for a later character   screwed over by eva    the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft   seeming like parker and oliver stone   who adapted it for the screen   are afraid to present her for what she is   even while it s being narrated by a hater of eva s   the omnipotent   antonio banderas     who presents her in a negative light    for a while   it looks like alan parker can t pull it off    however   the film pulls itself together in a flash   and after that song is over   and the giddily nihilistic song   goodbye and thank you     where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend   is magnificent   darkly comical   and just gleeful    from this point on   the film is hypnotic   satisfying   and satirical    no more punches are thrown   and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact    we see eva woo and marry juan   get him out of jail   rise to stardom   falter a bit   come back   and then gradually die of cancer   i think it was because of cancer      more importantly   many of the themes from the musical carry on with this   as well as some filling in the gaps reconnassaince work    juan   who is pretty underwritten in the musical   is given some extra scenes   and exposed as what he was for eva   an accessory    a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan   and understand his sadness more than we did before     from the   goodbye and thank you   number on   the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation   and saved a government   even while it left the nation s people downtrodden    but despite this   the nation still loved eva   and when she slipped into death   the world mourned her because she was a star    that s when our narrator   ch     comes out to show that she wasn t the great woman she really was   and expose her fame    describing this character is difficult   mainly because he has no real realistic background   he s said to be based on the revolutionary ch   guevera   but the two probably could have never met   like they do in the film     but he serves as a perspective on eva   but even his perspective can t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death    alan parker   no stranger to bizarre musicals   he s done   fame       the committments       bugsy malone     and   pink floyd the wall     the latter which is absolutely brilliant     nails the film   exposing everything for what it is    we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should   by the way it is presented    his direction is manipulative for a reason   to show the mourning for what it is    and there is energy throughout   with lots of bright colors   and scenes which are cinematically entertaning   as well as enriching and deep   such as the balcony scene where she sings   don t cry for me   argentina     and her death sequence   which is poignant becuase of how sad it is    madonna s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie   starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly   remaning there for the rest of the film    at the beginning   she looks like she s too busy concentrating on her singing to act   but she eventually gets it right   though never really getting the presence of   say   patti lupone   who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s      her death   though   is brilliant    her singing could be better though    i know she took lessons to improve her range and all   but it still sounds like she s trying to hard    she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding   like       patti  lupone   i heard her sing on an old   evita   cd   and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her      but it s generally very good   although not up to the brilliance the role really requires    antonio banderas   who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days   i m one of the few people who thinks he rocks     is extremely comanding in his performance   presenting a lovable narrator    his singing is very good   though nothing compared to the original   mandy patinkin    he does have a pretty good singing voice   and a great range    and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome   although very brief at times   in his role as juan   seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade    although it gets off to a rocky start     rocky    s polite for what it really is     it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical    like the other musical released in  96   woody allen s   everyone says i love you       it s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead   but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance    
586	0	susan granger s review of   glitter     20th century fox    there s less here than meets the eye    or   put it this way   if you thought madonna was awful in   shanghai surprise     mariah carey s worse in this reworking of   a star is born      she plays billie frank who   despite being abandoned by her singer alcoholic mother   valerie pettiford     believes she s destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is       you ve got this amazing gift   and you gotta use it     her roommate says       your voice   it s incredible     says another singer       i ain t never met anyone like you     proclaims julian   dice   black   max beesley     the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali like producer lover    problem is   her signature song     i didn t mean to turn you on   is wretched    and when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to   exploit   her by having her wear a bikini   the audience bursts into laughter    exploit mariah carey   who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow    come on    writer kate lanier s script is fatuous and director vondie curtis hall doesn t have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and   as a result of their incompetence   whispery voice d ms   carey seems to be embarrassed on screen    she almost cringes when the camera comes in for a close up   pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes    talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept   and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline   there s an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view    perhaps one of the reasons ms   carey suffered her highly publicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     glitter   is a pathetic 1    right now   it s tops on my list of the worst of 2001    
240	0	first troy beyer wrote the critically panned   b   a   p   s      now she makes her directorial debut   writing   directing   and starring in this sub par film about women talking about sex    though not without redeeming qualities   this film is bad    the basic story follows three single friends    jazz   beyer     lena   randi ingerman     and michelle   paget brewster      in their search for love    jazz has an idea for a local talk show   it would feature women talking about sex and dating    she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami    the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout   both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters    the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film    there are several moments of bad acting   corny dialogue   and emotional overextension    in a low budget independent film from a first time director   these faults can sometimes be forgiven   if the screenplay is fresh and solid    that is not the case here    the script suffers from random plot developments    there are four or five of these turns in the plot   each one raising the question   where did that come from      at one point   a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother    we are supposed to be moved   but since the scene is completely un led up to   we really don t care if she and her mother get along    we ve never seen her mother before    we never see her again    who cares    what s worse   these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy    at another point   a character announces that she can t have children    apparently   this is devastating    we wouldn t know this because she never talked about having kids before   but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her    the scene feels like an afterthought   its emotion manipulative and shallow    these scenes grow worse and worse   culminating in an absurd climax    two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing    one scene is a lover s spat between two minor characters    the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax    thinking on these scenes   it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities    but it does    first   it is original    we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups   and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea    it s something i don t think has been the subject of a film    second   the interviews of the miami women are sincere    taken together   they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners    the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes   but each tile is some woman s real experience    neither the picture of women   nor their picture of men   is truly representative   but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way    at some level   the stereotypes that emerge can be called true    i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their   likes   dislikes   skills   and thrills     but on the whole   it s pretty bad    and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting   corny dialogue   and emotional overextension    i ll give beyer one more strike   and then she s out    rated r   almost got an nc 17   for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity    
1541	1	tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever    not surprising   considering its tiny us 100   000 budget   to date it has earned in excess of us 130 million    that s a shocking 100 times profit    rumours have it that a smart internet  marketing  ploy was so successful in gaining cult like fanatics   by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews   the film just exploded in the box office   raking in millions on its opening weekend    shot in 16mm and video   i suspect        the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch    audiences are put in the first person perspective in the entire mis adventure   often wobbly and blurry at times   it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning    this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared   edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences    tbwp is simply smart    filmed to look as if it was really a stock shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project   one may suspect   like yours truly   that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film making    simply amazing in that respect   i must say    talk about impact   oh yes   tbwp does have quite a bit   in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing    i did   especially the last bit but i m not revealing more    you have to see it for yourself    i can t help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become    could it be that finally   an indie film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal    or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning    well   i guess the fact stays   tbwp is highly original   clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film    no gore   no special effects   i just can t get over how terribly smart this film is    
408	0	i still can t figure out why people went in droves to see this movie    now before you go assuming i m some sort of high brow snob   who can t appreciate a little dumb humor   let me say that i love cheap humor    i thought there s something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998    low brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun   the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent   there is no humor component    i wanted to like the waterboy   i really did    i think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie    actually   i smiled a couple of more times on top of that    not a great record for a 90 minute film    the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies    those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material    nothing could be further from the truth   as matter of fact   sandler s idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film    it s really a shame too   because this film had the potential to be very funny    i personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian   it s just that so far he hasn t been able to find the right film to showcase his talents    if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons   my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live    most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry    sandler plays a 31 year old   somewhat mentally challenged   waterboy for a college football team    the team s somewhat mentally disturbed coach   henry winkler   realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent up rage   which   if harnessed properly   would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field    you can figure out the rest from here    sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star    as i said   the film had a great deal of potential    the idea was a decent one   but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast    all of whom are very good   just hamstrung by really   really   lousy material    even sandler   annoying goofy voice and all   has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material    even as unfunny as his character is   i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film    but it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about    if their material had been just a bit better   this film could have been such a funny movie    fairuza balk plays sandler s leather wearing biker chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time    winkler is great as the coach who uses a   coaching for dummies    style book to help him get through games    the real standout though   is kathy bates    even with some of the worst material of her career to deal with   she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler s overprotective and overbearing mama    even with the performances of bates and winkler   there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie    although i get the distinct impression that without them   this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me    which is sad   because i can t really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became    it s obvious that those involved   specifically the actors   tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie    it s just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat

1869	1	wong kar wei s   fallen angels   is   on a purely visceral level   one of the most exciting films i ve seen in a long while    unfortunately   wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for    ordinarily   that alone would be enough to sink a movie   but in the case of   fallen angels     this is not so    every shot in this film is exciting just to   look   at    wong does really interesting things with the camera   but he doesn t allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over   as was the case with last years dismal   knock off     which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe    ugh      the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives    i can t say much more than that as i didn t really know what was going on most of the time    in fact   it wasn t until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character    the constantly moving camera doesn t really allow for the audience to associate with any one character    we re always kept at a distance from these people   i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters       fallen angels   is a refreshing change of pace from most hollywood films   which never bother to try anything different   at least on a visual level    in fact   i d go so far as to say that   fallen angels   is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i ve ever seen    sure   there s directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death   but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating    but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker   he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images    there were far too many instances during   fallen angels   in which i asked myself     now who are these people again    is this that first couple or the second couple      it was impossible to keep track    perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which   by introducing them to us with   name cards     as in scorsese s   mean streets      that s really besides the point   though    wong kar wei has proven himself   through very few films   that s he s a movie maker to watch    let s just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies    
1302	1	it is simply amazing how   the green mile   developed in its three hour running time    based on the stephen king series of the same title   the film starts out painfully slow   with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue    however   as the plot begins to progress   the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction    frank darabont   who masterfully followed a prisoner s story in   the shawshank redemption     this time follows the perspective of a prison guard   paul edgecomb   tom hanks      through edgecomb s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent   the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law    from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner     the green mile   is successful in creating sympathy for kind hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners    the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them    the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb    the ensemble acting in the film is perfect    hanks   david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles    they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles    they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience    the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting    some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson   sam rockwell   and michael duncan    hutchinson   playing percy wetmore   a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie    every time he appears on the screen   the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying    it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor   not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore   but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks    rockwell   an independent film veteran   plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection    as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours   he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others    this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable    the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan   as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill    duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child like behemoth   very similar to lennie small in of mice and men    his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause    his pain creates pain for the viewer    however   it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film    the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at   the jerry springer show      the scene   containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks    not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place   but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief    as the film flashes back to 1935   graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction    his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is   the scene is neither sad nor convincing    greene is not even given a final word   like some of the other characters   and we don t even see him walk the infamous green mile    however   as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters   such as coffey and eduard delacroix   michael jeter   as well as the five prison guards   the film becomes more interesting    the speed in   the green mile   is perfect    if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark   it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others    the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film   a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character       the green mile   is so good following the rough beginning   that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes   it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene    fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing    if you survive the first third of   the green mile   sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment    
1874	1	robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible   god given gifts   but are able to act like ordinary people    in   the natural     1984     he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs   the baseball player who was destined to be   the best there ever was     but still acted like a humble farm boy    in   butch cassidy and the sundance kid     1969     he was the most dangerous shot in the west   yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good looking charmer    even in   indecent proposal     1993     where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love   redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency   especially when reciting a tale of lost love    in his latest film     the horse whisperer     based on the best selling novel by nicholas evans   redford again plays such a character    redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie   i suppose the character of tom booker   a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses   was just too good to pass up    despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses   a magazine article coins the phrase   horse whisperer   to describe his uncanny talent     booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life    booker s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean   kristin scott thomas     a new york magazine editor whose daughter   grace   scarlett johansson     was recently in a horrible accident    the accident   which is filmed with gut wrenching horror   happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses   an eighteen wheeler kills grace s friend   severely wounds and traumatizes grace s horse   pilgrim   and causes grace to lose part of her right leg    annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed   grace will be healed as well   which leads her to booker    at first   she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse   but that doesn t work    instead   she packs up grace and pilgrim   leaves her husband   robert   sam neill   behind   and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother   frank   chris cooper     and his sister in law   diane   dianne wiest      in many ways   the film is like a journey   both literally and symbolically    the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal   and it s hard not to see annie and grace s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs   country    in   the horse whisperer     country is clearly the victor    the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness   and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide open spaces of montana that grace s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate   annie s controlling nature begins to relax   and pilgrim once again learns to trust people    redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed   a river runs through it   six years ago    in many ways     the horse whisperer   comes from the same poetic vein as   river     and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera time on the grass and mountains    but then   that would ruin the magic    much of the film s photography is truly elegant   and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land    to further emphasize this   redford and cinematographer robert richardson     natural born killers       platoon     cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film   which takes place in new york   with mostly cold   harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1   85   1 aspect ratio   when the action shifts to montana   richardson switches to soft focus and natural lighting   and the screen widens to a 2   35   1 aspect ratio    in terms of the story itself     the horse whisperer   gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean s   a brief encounter     1945   and clint eastwood s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller s   the bridges of madison county     richard lagravenese   co screenwriter here also adapted   bridges        although   the horse whisperer   has a strong romantic sensibility   i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story    it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who s being left behind for this brief   heart sweeping affair   but there rarely is    in   the horse whisperer     the thankless role of being the fuddy duddy husband falls to sam neill    he plays the character as a decent   hard working man who is a good husband and father   his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him    he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away   but simply because he happens to be a normal   fairly uninspiring man    there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character    it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen   booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all   while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out of place in a baseball cap    as they enter the pen   booker assuredly swings over the fence   while robert hesitates   then opens the gate and   in a goofy moment   forgets to close it behind him    it s a small scene   but it clearly demonstrates the movie s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness    after all   booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it    the best scenes in   the horse whisperer   tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie   but rather the healing process of grace and her horse    although booker s horse training methods are mythical and unrealistic   the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing    these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace   some of which are humorous   and all of which are tender and true    at some point   i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more    nevertheless   redford is obviously a romantic at heart   and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film    there are no dramatic sex scenes   but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow dancing   always moving ever closer together   that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together    although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character   there are enough moments like that which make   the horse whisperer   worth the price of admission

critics society   ofcs   and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain t it cool news    no   the   mini major  was afraid we d let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit   that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved   by this writer   at least   franchise    something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get go   cotton weary   liev schrieber     the former

iconic costume    with scream 3   the novelty of ghostface s ever mutating identity has worn off some   but the character remains conceptually potent    conceptually   the execution of ghostface s master plan this time around is creaky   because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we d come to understand in scream and scream 2   the movie gets in the silly habit of saying   all bets are off      in reference to the   rules   of a trilogy s third act   but there s a difference between rule breaking and cheating    with the departure of kevin williamson   who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3   that   for reasons incomprehensible to me   was ignored   save the notion of   stab 3       kruger needed to be reined in tighter   and by wes craven    craven s direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects    how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo   the slacker duo of kevin smith movies     akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny    it pains me to write this   but scream 3 s comedy is generally laughless   with the exception of well timed performances by josh pais   as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven s music of the heart     jamie kennedy   resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2     and parker posey   through sheer force of will as a b actress      the visuals are much weaker in part three   as well the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming s camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before       aside   in the wake of columbine   craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3 why the sanctimony   when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves      finally   marco beltrami s music cues the suspense too blatantly do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2   it s mostly silent    sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere   here   they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve jangling score    i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe   the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii woefully out of synch with its prequels   scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish   and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs    the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t     part three must disappoint     
1451	1	this is a good year if you want plenty of sci fi on your multiplex     from the comedies mars attacks and men in black   to luc besson s powerful the fifth element   and to this   sci fi horror that is event horizon       more is on the way with contact and alien   ressurection being released later this year      the story is thus   in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive    a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe   instantaneously    this is achieved by creating a gateway   infact   a black hole   between the craft and it s required destination    in this case   from near neptune to proxima prime    however   when the event horizon attempts this   it dissappears   without trace   leaving two searches for it fruitless    seven years later   it reappears   transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts    a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate    the team is led by laurence fishburne   and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive    as the team search the event horizon   they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around    not a good sign        to make matters worse   as they search the ship   they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse   some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago    it soon becomes apparent that   wherever the ship went   it bought something back with it    something very   very evil        the first thing you ll notice in this film is it s incredible visual effects    they really are eye popping   with some great models to boot    the acting is quite good   with some occasional witty moments    sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues   but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team   in a cool   calm   take no nonense manner    it is his acting skills that help hold this film together    the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one    it starts off incredibly well   but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled   leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur    however   the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this   producing one the most nail biting   or in my case   straw of my drink biting      climaxes i ve recently witnessed    overall   event horizon is a smart film indeed    it s very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals    but be warned   the horror scenes   despite being very brief are very   very   gory    not for the squemish    
1882	1	for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and   high art     the son s room is an inventive   subtle alternative    written by   directed   and starring nanni moretti   it takes us through the slow   complicated path of bereavement    slow is the best description for the film at first    it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal   happy family    father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities    they laugh   spend free time together   and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder    you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome    but suddenly   the son is found to be dead after a diving accident    the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it   but can also be trying on the attention span    though the film drags and even repeats itself   this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving    though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production   it doesn t come across as a vanity piece    one might wish he hadn t picked the profession of analyst for the father   giovanni   which he stars as     if only because this makes his character s reactions so predictable    what saves it is a well written script   with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction    the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative   or that remind a depressed person of loss    you start to take notice of the cracked dishes   ignored when familial bliss was in full swing    you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block   and not necessarily huge events like graduation    even better are the role reversals that take place within the household    while giovanni and paola   laura morante   do check up on their daughter irene   jasmine trinca     there is a sense of being on autopilot    not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more   she ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them    these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms   frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic   unexpected change    respectfully   gender issues never enter the picture    self propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing   so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family    though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends   there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic   or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives    most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama   speeches   and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing    in contrast   the son s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning   denial   depression   anger   bargaining   acceptance   through each of its main characters    it s not the most engaging 100 minutes   but it is certainly easy to relate to

601	0	the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows   jane march was very cute as jane   and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length    if you haven t already figured it out   i didn t like this movie very much    the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme    tarzan   casper van dien   has now left the jungle and living in civilized society    he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane   played by the aptly named jane march    back in his former home of africa   a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city       mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city      anyway   tarzan s old jungle friend appears to him in a vision    tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city    he leaves jane   his first mistake   in my opinion   and travels to africa    of course   jane is hot on her ape man s heals    the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys    sound like a dumb explanation of the plot    it s actually an improvement over the real thing    the acting is just plain awful    i m not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film   but it wasn t acting    jane march wasn t a heck of a lot better   but at least she is easy on the eyes    compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re recorded   and i ve seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies    added to the sound problems was the cinematography    this film was filled with beautiful african scenery    but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me    quite frankly   i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment    then we have the special effects       special effects in a tarzan movie      you are no doubt asking yourself    yes friends   the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story    probably for the sake of using cgi   since it did nothing but hurt the story    in most parts   they weren t bad   just nothing special    but   they were more than a little on the hokey side    except of course   when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie    the grand finale s special effects went right into the toilet at that point    it almost looked like they had run out of money    these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production    i took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city    ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don t mix    stay far away from this version of tarzan    
107	0	based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie   be happy   i won t bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons     this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box office   after scoring huge successes with men in black   7 10     directed by the same man who controlled this one   and independence day   6 10      can you say       the  third times not a charm    plot   james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation s top scientists   and threatening to take over the united states within a week    critique   i did not laugh once during this entire picture    when you consider that this film is a part comedy   that s not a very good sign    i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes    when you consider that the other   part   of this film is geared as an action adventure   i would say that this another negative sign    and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow   the story line tired   reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving   and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one liners   weak characterizations and an anti climactic end   you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this   big   summer blockbuster    it blows    or as they say in french     eet blows      could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it    maybe    could it be that most of the special effects don t show up until the last half hour   and even then   we don t see anything that its trailers hadn t already given away    perhaps    or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big budget movies   that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own    naaaaaaah    a bad movie is a bad movie    on a positive note   i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek   who seemed underused   in my humble opinion     and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in    branagh was also fun as the scenery munching   over the top bad guy   but that s pretty much where the entertainment buck stopped    smith and kline were static at best   the plot full of holes   and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others    i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie    then again   there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage       huh       oh  yeah   but the rest of the movie sucked    little known facts about this film and its stars   will smith has starred in two of the ten all time top grossing films worldwide   1997 s summer blockbuster men in black   7 10     for which he also recorded the grammy winning title song   and 1996 s independence day   6 10      he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career    kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama   and has been married to the cute as a button actress phoebe cates since 1989    they have two kids together   greta simone and owen    one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has   kasdan   written on it    lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies   including the big chill   silverado   i love you to death   grand canyon and french kiss    salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over   even though she spoke no english    she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders  mi vida loca   no   not the rickie martin video     and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez s desperado opposite antonio banderas    since then   she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez s films    she stands 5 2     was born in southeast mexico   and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother    one of the actresses cast as branagh s lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling   a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner   7 10      another is dutch born frederique van der wal   who is one of the world s most recognized supermodels   having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times   as well as harper s bazaar   vogue and mademoiselle

261	0	   mercury rising   has numerous flaws   but there is one that really stands out   its central plot device is unnecessary    that s right    the major aspect of the film   that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy   action flicks could be dropped from the beginning   and the movie would turn out exactly the same   if not better    this central device is the fact that a nine year old boy is autistic    his name is simon   and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow   alec baldwin   wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it    simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film   and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent   unfair world against his will   with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him    the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of   mercury rising      i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon s character and his relationship with willis   but here it is lost    miko hughes   the young actor who plays simon   goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic   he walks slowly   drawls his words   kicks and screams when he s touched   and has a hard time looking at other people    it s a difficult role for an adult   much less a young child   to play   and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn t playing like he s autistic    unlike dustin hoffman s performance in   rain man   or leonardo dicaprio s in   what s eating gilbert grape     we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting    however   unlike   rain man   which used its character s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story     mercury rising   could go right about its generic   predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid    hell   he doesn t even have to be shy    in fact   the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role   rather than just being carted around under willis  arm    willis  character   art jeffries   is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything    he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon s house   where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide    of course   we know that isn t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil   square jawed government hitman with a mean looking crew cut knock off the parents    simon was able to get away   and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet   which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked    jeffries    who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it    knows there is something more   and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon    this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon s parents is crawling everywhere   attempting to kill simon at the hospital   on the highway   and every other place he goes    late in the movie   jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey   kim dickens   who he meets at a coffee shop    of all the hard to believe aspects of the movie   this is the worst    i can believe in the decency of the human heart   but stacey s character is far too accommodating    not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery   she lets him into her apartment at two o clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him   and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent    the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point    the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences   but even here   mercury rising   doesn t rise to the challenge    the movie was directed by harold becker   who has made some good suspense films including   sea of love     1989   and   malice     1993     but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion    there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman   played by peter stormare   that is so ineptly directed   shot and edited   that i had no idea 1   exactly where they were on the streetcar   2   who was hitting who   and 3   where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were    the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building   and features a harrowing   yawn   scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building   not because he has to   but because it s more suspenseful that way    taken as a whole     mercury rising   is an tepid   confused movie that lacks style   wit   and any traces of a sense of humor    usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles   but here he is too straight and serious    this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time   but it ends up failing on both fronts    maybe the book was better   but the way it s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore    
273	0	the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits    the rationale is sound   but in many cases of this and recent years   the sequel is a shoddy product that s exposed for the cash milking vehicle it really is    last year s speed 2 and scream 2   as well as this year s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory    in some cases   a sequel can even discredit its predecessor   as with the latest neo slasher flick   i still know what you did last summer    whatever uniqueness the original might ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller    julie james   jennifer love hewitt   and ray bronson   freddie prinze jr     are back from the original to star in i still know   reprising their roles in typical fashion    julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling out at the beginning of the movie   leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson   matthew settle      will and julie hit it off   and along with friends karla   brandy norwood   and tyrell   mekhi phifer     the foursome heads off to a radio station giveaway vacation in the tropics    unfortunately   things aren t so peachy once they arrive   and with a regularity you could set your watch by   the infamous fisherman   muse watson   is back with his hook    it s another bloody showdown   complete with cliffhanger ending    there s not much that s original about i still know   and with the market saturated by gen x thrillers like this one   it s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel    for die hard fans of the genre   this will be required viewing material   but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer    the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work   but rather a tense   string based score and manipulative editing    the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue    he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments    much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point    the whole reason the plot exists   julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station   is a dead giveaway   lessening suspense and creating a hurry up and wait timing problem    and   whereas the killer s identity might ve been a question in the first movie   it s almost a given here   which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically    three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as   the killer      they re almost used to it   and the performances show it   not hewitt   nor prinze   nor brandy   nor phifer give a decent show    and so   in the end   it s left wide open for a third movie and   most likely   a brand new supporting cast    god help us    
1596	1	i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one   folks    i loved the wedding singer    but it gets worse    if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence            hell   same paragraph as the wedding singer   i m bound to be lynched    well lynch me then   because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory   with titanic as the only exception    right away   you re ready to discount my review   aren t you    you re thinking that i can t possibly know what i m talking about    after all   this is adam sandler right        well   there s more            i actually got choked up   and more than once    yes   the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes    but before you shrug me off as an imbecile   i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself    the wedding singer is the story of robby hart   sandler     a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so    but when his own wedding results in a no show for the bride   angela featherstone as linda     robby begins to re examine his life   and wonder why true love doesn t exist for people like him    in the process of performing at these receptions   robby meets a waitress named julia   played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore   whose reputation is anything but this character    julia too is engaged   and when robby finds himself without a wife   his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding   seeing as how her fiance   the   miami vice   loving glenn   matthew glave     doesn t seem all that interested    as the time goes by   we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding   he s merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup   something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women    it s obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her   but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for    this isn t sleepless in seattle   but i d actually compare it to that before i d compare it to happy gilmore    while the wedding singer maintains some of that post snl cornball humor   its sincerity and charm carry it a very   very long way    sandler is great in his role   and yes   if you allow it   you can take him seriously    barrymore seems perfect along side him   and although the two more likely represent gen x moronism and party girl ditzism   respectively     the two go together like bread and butter as a mid eighties couple    one scene in particular   where julia ponders the future in a mirror   is so well done   i was on the verge of tears    unfortunately   sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no brainer   but it s got so much surprise substance packed inside that i m encouraging everyone to go see it    in fact   the entire theater applauded when the film ended   and laughs were so consistent   some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar    the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth   and for those of us that are old enough to remember it   it was a bodacious trip back   and done very well      sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm   or is it anti charm        while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit   grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars    it s hilarious   and it s touching    it s got that great cheezy humor   but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected    this is one to see again and again    is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998    my   magic 8 ball   predicts it is certain

253	0	let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years    i am not too fond of ted turner s world championship wrestling   however   and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight    the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs   david arquette   aptly cast as a neandrathal   and sean dawkins   scott caan   who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show    when they finally get to see their hero   wcw world champion jimmy king   played by oliver platt    i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king     he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair   a wasted palitaliano   in a role originally meant for real life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later   and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff   they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it     they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back    when they find him   they discover in horror that jimmy king s real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv    king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king    after convincing king that they don t care that his persona isn t real   gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro   after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw s pay per view    gee   whiz   there are so many things wrong with this movie   i don t know where to begin    yes   i do        1   the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff   wcw president who thought up this project   thinks of wrestling fans    he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously    he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously    i got news for you   eric   nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that   this is 2000   you know   not 1985    i know he ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn t meant to be taken seriously but it is   because that s how big an ego bischoff has    2   there was a documentary made in 1998   wrestling with shadows   that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation   vince mcmahon s screwing bret   the hitman   hart out of the title    this movie s storyline is basically a comic rip off of that plot with the poor man s wayne and garth thrown in    eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair   but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon   and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart    3    the movie s main wrestler   jimmy king   has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him    no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age   we want bad asses today    4   why make this a comedy   instead of an emotional   rocky style drama    i know wrestling isn t a sport   but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end    5    in the movie   gordie starts up an ill fated romance with nitro girl sasha   the lovely rose mcgowan    what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i ll never understand     only to find that she has hospitalized king s trainer for sinclair    wouldn t it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy girl for the bad guy cliche    i hate that    6    last   but certainly not least   there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen   nor did i laugh once either    the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie   for these reasons    1   they re the better promotion    2   they have better and younger talent   performers and wrestlers    3    they give their fans what they want and don t treat them like idiots    4   they re winning the ratings and they re the promotion everybody cares about    5   simply put   they could make a movie a hundred times better   and they could do a wrestling movie the right way    the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end    and if i spoiled it for you   good   i saved you from wasting seven dollars    
1343	1	more than forty years ago   the   sword and sandals   genre of historical epic ruled the box office    during the 1950 s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope       ben hur         cleopatra         the robe         sparticus         the fall of the roman empire         quo vadis      sometimes brilliant   sometimes campy   the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood    since then   epics have appeared infrequently     the last emperor       braveheart     and some of the best have been small screen affairs produced in the 1970 s     roots       shogun        yet   the phrase   we who are about to die salute you   has been absent until now       gladiator   begins in germania in a   d   180    roman general maximus   russell crowe   has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius   richard harris     and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting    however   the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus   joaquin phoenix   will prove a poor successor   so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again    when commodus hears the plan   he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered    maximus escapes from the executioners   but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son    a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa       why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus  place is never explained      an african named juba   djimon hounsou   treats maximus  wounds    proximo   oliver reed     a gladiator who won his freedom   purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena    of course   maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier   and his fame spreads    when commodus reopens the coliseum   proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete    our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus  sister lucilla   connie nielsen      the similarities to   braveheart   are obvious   an evil king   a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family   the aid of a lovestruck princess    also   like mel gibson s epic     gladiator   has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero s anger    it s a simple tale of good versus evil    maximus has all the manly virtues   nobility of purpose   courage in battle   loyalty to king and country   physical stamina   and devotion to family    commodus is his opposite in every way   a sniveling   selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience    the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70  male   and that seems appropriate       gladiator   is a guy movie   would the opposite of a   chick flick   be a   dick flick          there s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences       those easily offended by gore should stay away      lucilla is the only female character   and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife    joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance    in the scene where commodus kills his father   phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father s love or pride    throughout the picture   phoenix manages to give depth to a character who s scripted as a caricature of evil    i ve been a russell crowe fan since   romper stomper      this role doesn t offer him the complexities of his parts in   l    a   confidential   and   the insider      essentially his job is to grunt heroically    but his voice   which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp   is perfect for the genre    the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role    i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar    my only major quibble with   gladiator   is its stylized look    several scenes are tinted    we ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately   particularly in   payback   and   the matrix      i don t get the appeal of the style   which makes feature films look like tv ads    in   payback   it was merely annoying   but in   gladiator   it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d etre of the roman epic       perhaps it s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer generated shots      also   the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously       it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books   leaving a half blurred trail of images of himself behind      with a more realistic look     gladiator   could be even more satisfying than   braveheart   because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion    bottom line   a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices    
1860	1	mike myers   you certainly did throw us a   frickin  bone here in what you call   the biggest austin powers adventure yet      austin powers   the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers   international man of mystery    many are skeptical about sequels   saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original   but austin powers   tswsm goes beyond the first film    austin powers   the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles    he reprises his role as the title character   austin powers   the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967   and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr   evil   also played by mike myers   from destroying the earth    tswsm leaves off where the original stopped   with dr   evil s   frisch s big boy  space capsule floating through space    dr   evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule   plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967   in which he plans to steal austin powers    mojo     what keeps austin going with spy talents    upon his return to his secret lair   which is now a starbucks coffee shop   dr   evil learns that his evil henchman   which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau   have created a 1 8 size clone of dr   evil   which is later named mini me    the evil mini me replaces scott evil   played by seth green   as dr   evil s son in the madman s mind   because dr   evil thinks of scott to be only   quasi evil      dr   evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him   and now he has one    dr   evil tells mini me     you complete me     in a loving manner    dr   evil loving    wow    mike myers  third role is as fat bastard   a scottish henchman of dr   evil s   who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers  frozen body    austin powers learns of dr   evil s trip back into the 60s   and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967   to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it    once arriving in the year 1967   austin travels to his   pad     his smashing home dance club   where he meets felicity shagwell   played by heather graham   a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr   evil    as the film progresses   hilarious one liners are thrown at us   mainly by dr   evil   for example     don t go there   girlfriend      to the president of the united states    many witty gags take place   note the entire tent scene   and just plain   funny scenes which are so stupid  they re funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes    take for example   scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is    the way austin powers   tswsm uses its humor is clever   throwing a hilarious scene at you   followed by five minutes of one liners   followed by another outrageous scene   so you never stop laughing    there was honestly not one moment in austin powers   tswsm where i wasn t laughing    the last film that i laughed so hard in   was well   austin powers    it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it    the film even makes fun of itself in a line   something along the lines of     it s funny how england and southern california look nothing alike      tswsm was filmed in southern california   but was supposed to take place in england    i can tell you one thing  he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character   which is all over television   newspapers   magazines   and the movie theaters    i believe that dr   evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did    dr   evil provided more laughs   more memorable moments   and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around   who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film    i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away   but from screenplay writer mike myers   not fat bastard    also making a great addition to the series is mini me   who is played by verne troyer    even though the midget actor is 30 years old   he is adorable by dr   evil s side constantly    the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality   such as lack of character development   barely any detailed plot characteristics   and barely any good acting   but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor    mike myers   with his three roles   acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor   disguising himself completely in one of the roles       fat bastard   all three characters are different   and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them    heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm   and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did   who gave a very flat performance in the original   speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion    speaking of hurley   she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments    hopefully   graham tags along for future austin powers adventures    the bottom line  a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing

130	0	susan granger s review of   ghosts of mars     sony pictures entertainment    horror auteur john carpenter     halloween       vampires     strikes out with this sci fi eco fable that s so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green lit    the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year s   pitch black     involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood thirsty   marauding aliens    in the year 2176   there are 640   000 earthlings on mars   living in a matriarchal society led by a commander   played by pam grier    grier   pill poppin  natasha henstridge   and some rookie mars police officers   clea duvall   jason statham   travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch   desolation   williams   that s ice cube   to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder    but when they re besieged by demented   zombie like   body snatching miners   they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection    it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and   soon after   most of the miners went bonkers as long dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies   lopping off heads as   vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet     according to a scientist   joanna cassidy      carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the   night of the living dead    like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing    but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed   along with the order of their elimination    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     ghosts of mars   thuds to a laborious   bottom of the barrel 1    perhaps   indeed   there is a curse on mars films   if you recall two other duds     mission to mars   and   red planet      
1325	1	this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday    jon bennet   played by andrew howard   is an extremely good assassin    as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him    he has become an unquestioning weapon    he is in the employ of a kingpin   david calder   far more evil than he is    but even assassins have innocent pasts    he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school    complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime    a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin    calder is a familiar actor in britain   though not frequently seen in the us    he was seen in the world is not enough    here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years    he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake    his lair is underground   apparently in a sewer   where he lives like the king of sewer rats    it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet s life    paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin s lair   he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness    by using semi darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world    this is a world that is cold and unfriendly    sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see    this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach    we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that    the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross   but it is sarossy s film all the way    it creates indelible images of evil    i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low  3 on the  4 to  4 scale       i do hope they do not use the tagline   don t mess with mr   in between

1964	1	anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases           especially hercules          emotion    all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren t going to hold anyone s interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together    not since disney s beauty   the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works    the story of the romanov family   the rulers of russia   and their downfall begins the film    anastasia   one of the daughters   narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin   voiced by christopher lloyd   with her grandmother   voiced by angela landsbury      but anastasia gets lost   and grows up with no memory of her royal origins    the grandmother lives in paris   hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia   the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution    a young woman named anya   voiced by meg ryan   runs across dimitri   john cusack   and vlad   kelsey grammar     who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money    they pick anya to pose as their princes   and of course   it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia    dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner   and meanwhile   rasputin is not dead   and plots his revenge against the last romanov    the plot is actually quite well structured    there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later   but it moves along fast enough that they ll never have time to be bored    what this really means is that the adults won t be bored by it either    there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny   and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses    there is   of course   lots of comedy for the kids   including rasputin s pet bat   bartok   hank azaria     who is easily the funniest thing in the film    however   the comical scenes never distract from the drama   but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly    the animation is gorgeous   the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators    not since beauty   the beast have animated characters had so much life to them    even without the voices   they act    the musical number in paris is a show stopper   with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style    as with all recent animated features   there are songs   however   these songs do more than just provide fodder for top 40 singers to get on the radio   although there are three of them during the end credits      the songs are all very catchy   and advance the plot   instead of just being showpieces   except for the paris number   but that s so much fun   it s okay            i can t reccomend anastasia highly enough    it s a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics    kids and adults alike will enjoy it   and it s also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney    
373	0	first impressions   critically   a close to awful film   but money wise   it has been doing   and will continue to do   great    a sometimes funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring    an orginal plot that grows old real fast    one of the only 90 minute films that i ve gotten bored through    men in black has defied the odds    when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long   i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas    however   i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas   but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea   which summer audiences have embraced   that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie    tommy lee jones and will smith play two   government   agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society    the ridiculous plot begins when an alien   bug     played weirdly by vincent d onofrio   who was so great in full metal jacket   lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that s somewhere on   orion s belt      anyway   the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy   or a higher power will blow up the earth    the premise is ridulous   but that is not why i didn t like this film    i love original plots    this one had an original one    but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot   he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films    whenever i saw d onofrio s bug stomp and eat people in the film   it got terribly boring after a while    while smith s wise cracks did fill in the gaps   it wasn t enough    and also   i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent   they can t have contact with any humans really    and here i see jones   at a satellite computer   watching his lover plant the garden    a sentimental moment in an alien movie    nice try   but i don t think so    it doesn t work here    it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring   we don t only have aliens to worry about   but now we have jones s conscience    i came into the movie not wanting to see jones s conscience   but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it    maybe it s unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were    nevertheless   even though some parts are indeed funny   the plot in this movie grew old and boring    quick    
1947	1	there is a striking scene early in   city of angels     where all the angels who live unseen in our midst   gather at the beach to watch the sun rise    the camera moves above them   showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women   all garbed in black    then the camera moves in on the face of seth   an angel played by nicolas cage   and as the sun rises   he smiles and his entire face lights up    you see   the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets   but they cannot feel a human touch    it is an important scene for several reasons    first of all   it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible    the film presents these fantastic beings as normal looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth   watching what goes on with little interference    there are none of the standard   hokey angel references used in recent films like   angels in the outfield     1994   or   michael     1996      the angels here are stark and believable    this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition   for its shows how god s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot   and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures   like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs   or the smell of the salt in the air    there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel   although there is much beauty in it as well    they eternally walk the earth   listening to our thoughts   touching us in our pain   and leading the dying to heaven    like human existence   being an angel is often confused and unsure       city of angels   is essentially a love story   between seth and a human   a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie   meg ryan      he first sees her when he is in her operating room   waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven    maggie is distraught   doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table   and seth is moved by her efforts and   more importantly   her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies    angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain   and seth does what he can with his invisible touch   but it s not enough    he wants to be with her and share her pain   not just stand back at a distance    he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to   fall   and become human    he learns this from another fallen angel   played by dennis franz     n   y   p   d    blue     in a touching and humorous performance    sitting at a diner together   franz tells cage s character about how wonderful it is to be human   to be able to taste food   feel another person s skin   smell the air   and most importantly   have a loving wife and children    of course   there is pain to go along with all this   but for seth   it will be worth it       city of angels   is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender s haunting 1988 film   wings of desire      wenders  film was more like a poem   it was the feeling   the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened    the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles   and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human    and   unlike most foreign films that are re made into hollywood fare   it doesn t suffer extensive damage    this may be because director brad silberling     casper     and screenwriter dana stevens     blink     wanted to make   city of angels   its own movie   inspired by   wings of desire     but not an attempt to copy it    and yet     city of angels   is not a typical hollywood movie    it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale     the english patient       whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world    seale creates many striking visuals   in addition to the beach scene   there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around   looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by    while the film travels along a charted plot   it takes time to develop its characters and situations   it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly   and shows just how thin those boundaries are    both cage and ryan give soulful   soft spoken performances    ryan   who is usually so bouncy and energetic   truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch    cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple   heartfelt gazes   and speaks with the comforting   knowing voice that only an angel could have    what is most striking about   city of angels   is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay   which is both unexpected and challenging    it s not a formulaic hollywood ending   because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time    it doesn t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance    instead   it offers something much better   something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive

1747	1	in a flashback   the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film   the hanging garden   tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance    horrified   the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows   the rule of 6      if you don t break off a kiss by the count of 6   then you committed a sin with the boy    and most of all   the grandmother wants to know if she has   protection      she must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times    the richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style    although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture   that moniker misses the mark    yes   every member of the household has their own special problems   but the writer didn t choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident    this delightful little picture mixes love   tragedy and pathos   resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction    during the opening credits we observe the boy   sweet william   at the center of the story    first   he s an average sized young lad who is slapped off screen by his father    next   he s 300 pound teenager   played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte    when the opening credits end   we cut to 10 years later    william is now an average sized   reasonably happy adult   played with love and compassion by chris leavins    william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free spirited and foul mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover   fletcher   joe s   keller      kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy    nicole burnell   who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter   plays the teenage rosemary    the father of the family   whiskey mac   peter macneill     is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful    his wife   iris   seana mckenna     says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids    rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine year old violet   the sister whom william meets for the first time    as the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home   william wanders off to try on one of his old coats   which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self    the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways    he takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways    rosmary s trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated   and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath   all while talking to her brother    as much as anything   the film is a series of character sketches    in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter   a homosexual one    although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex   his mother is aghast    a woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife   dusty miller   martha irving     who   for a fee   will have heterosexual sex with william    with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational    dusty   after asking iris to watch her daughter   takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex    all of this notwithstanding   he still prefers males    the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face to face with himself when younger    this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited    in the most devastating   he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself    even here   the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker    the ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot    the hanging garden runs 1   31    it is rated r for strong sexuality   language   violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature    
1268	1	it s ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director s cut of the film    films such as aliens   the abyss   the wild bunch   blade runner   and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker s integrity   later chopped up or mucked with by the studio    the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films    the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson s 1995 masterpiece the professional   which is known as l   on around the world   is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director s cut    for years   i have heard of an   international   version available only in laserdisc format   which has eluded me for years    i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors  cuts   including l   on    but after countless searches in laserdisc stores   i could never find it    until now    the film follows the story of l   on   played by jean reno   a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello    he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12 year old girl named mathilda   played by then newcomer natalie portman   whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops    one day   a crew of the cops   lead by gary oldman in an over the top performance   kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries    taking pity on her   l   on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life    mathilda learns of l   on s hit man profession and decides to follow in l   on s footsteps as a   cleaner      she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l   on he has kept locked away as part of his profession    at this point   the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in    the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l   on and mathilda   footage that american censors deemed   too explicit      i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle    the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda s and l   on s motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops    there s even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean hugues anglade   star of queen margot   besson s la femme nikita   and killing zoe    with these additional scenes replaced   l   on and matilda s relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version    the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes   the film becomes primarily a heavy   emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film    the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema    my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional   throw down twenty bucks   and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece    director writer   luc besson producer   luc besson   claude besson starring   jean reno   natalie portman   gary oldman   danny aiello  
1963	1	the latest epos from lars is a blast   although a rather moody one    this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something    the church   calvinistic   is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower   they are considered being too unrestrained    in these surroundings we find the to be weds jan and bess   played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson    jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess      is just bess   a bit naive and innocent   in every aspect of the word     at first    at the wedding party we are told an anecdote   illustrating her infinite kindness   she once lend a bike to an stranger   her best friends bike however    but bess is suffering in this scary religious society    we soon take part in a funeral where a man   fallen off the orthodox path   is laid to rest while doomed to hell    women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church    when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend   almost manic   that her friends try to calm her down a bit    the time has come when jan is to return to the rig   bess is falling into the darkness of depression   her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves    she can t stand the thought of life without her husband    we witness her dialogues with god   she speaks both parts   paranoia      convincing god to return jan from the oilrig   and her prayers are heard    an accident on the rig bring him back   paralysed from the neck and down    now he can t satisfy her need for physical love   he try to persuade her into finding a lover   with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail    at first she resist   but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply    imagine what this is doing to the poor girl    the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby   accompanied by music from the era   procol harum   deep purple   t rex and others    the use of hand held camera and lack of any make up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre    the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant   though a bit too gloomy for my taste    i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue   37   2 le matin   and bitter moon   lunes de fiel      emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances   this must be the reason for giving it the   grand prix du jury   in cannes this year   although we had hoped for the   palme d or        the screenplay is now available in print   the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july   just in time for the danish premiere    
740	0	well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you    because thats all that there really is          i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot    for one thing   a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity          i am not saying that this isn t possible      but it does leave one to wonder       i  know i did    another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out          and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations    there was one scene that should have been short        but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking      ok enough already get on with it    there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do        things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort        another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning    this movie is also very predictable        you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment      granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you    also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated        it gets boring at times to tell you the truth        even though there is still action going on    another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero    some of the characters are not proper for their roles    the acting is fine but the characters just don t seem to add up    if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn t rate this movie too highly but that s just the thing this movie isn t just the plot   its the whole package and this package is really well done    the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie    the special effects are just amazing   you can t tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live   in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn t be able to say that the creature wasn t there during filming   extinct or not    another thing is the destruction scenes        wow   those were masterpieces      well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino s make this one of the reasons to see this movie    this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office      unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do      i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments      go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me    one little side note   although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid   there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly          and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance          you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made            i thought i d put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick        its not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this

1238	1	jerry springer has got nothing on   wild things      john mcnaughton s new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer s notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks    bisexuality   threesomes   poolside catfights   slutty rich bimbos   even redneck gator wrestling   they re all part of the movie s raucous   complex storyline    but even trash tv topicality can t drag   wild things   down    this crazy campfest plays like something you d find late night on the usa network   only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast    despite a smattering of needless scenes   most of them sexual in nature     there s wicked fun to be had here       wild things   would be a guilty pleasure   only there s no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it    high school guidance counselor sam lombardo   matt dillon   is well liked in the town of blue bay   especially by pretty   popular kelly van ryan   denise richards     whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave s most financially prominent    hoping to take her crush to a physical level   kelly seductively slinks into lombardo s house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser   but   the very next day   tearfully admits to her trollop mother   theresa russell   that she was raped    before long   blue bay detectives ray duquette   kevin bacon   and gloria perez   daphne rubin vega   are listening to similar allegations from kelly s rebel classmate suzie toller   neve campbell      lombardo   who maintains his innocence   hires neck brace sporting   opportunistic lawyer ken bowden   bill murray   to defend him in court    the previews give away the following revelations   so if you haven t seen any of the movie s spots on the television or in the theater   you might want to skip to the next paragraph    while cross examining suzie on the witness stand   bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place    that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her    to pay lombardo for the damages   kelly s mother breaks her daughter s trust fund and gives him  8   5 million    but lombardo   kelly and suzie are actually all working together   and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can    duquette and perez   however   begin to suspect that there s more afoot to the case than just false accusations    if there s a major drawback to   wild things     it s that it s oversexed to a fault    the much talked about hotel room menage a trois between dillon   campbell and richards is a turn off    it s also cut short   sorry   guys     and should have been cut shorter    the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often    what we don t see is far more effective than what we do    another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene    er   no thanks    also   bacon s duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten    daphne rubin vega   from broadway s   rent     tries to compensate for a superfluous character    theresa russell is just plain wooden    and when   in the end   all is out in the open   ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary    but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises   some predictable   some not   that never seems to end       wild things   has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews   and most are so gleefully   over the top nasty that you can t help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship    a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent   murray s a stitch   especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo s case and flipping them off    and don t leave when the closing credits hit the screen   or you ll miss the film s best part    four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns   plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell    speaking of bombshells   denise richards   who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top   does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in   starship troopers      matt dillon flexes his sleepy voiced sex appeal   and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision    neve campbell   lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig   gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio    re edited and toned down a bit   the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths    but what we re given works well enough       wild things   is highly entertaining and   indeed   very wild    
988	0	there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling   hapless straight man from the hysterical   naked gun   films   crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he s committed himself to starring in since    the wavering movie spoofs   however   are less forgivable    to be fair     wrongfully accused     the send up in question and nielsen s third parody since the last   gun     isn t quite as excruciatingly humorless as his   dracula   dead and loving it   or   spy hard     which is a mighty good thing    nielsen is still in tip top comedic form   able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns   but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them   and he needs one very soon       wrongfully accused   meshes together the premises of   the fugitive   and   patriot games     casting its always game star as ryan harrison   get it       a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress   kelly le brock      she   however   sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband   michael york     a crime actually committed by a one armed   one legged   one eyed man   aaron pearl      harrison is arrested   found guilty and sentenced to death   but escapes from a prison bus   of course   and then is pursued by a determined u   s   marshal named fergus falls   richard crenna   unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones  already smirky oscar winning role      there s also a mystery brunette   melinda mcgraw   and an assassination subplot involving the u   n   secretary general   but like any of it matters       wrongfully accused   gets off to an assured start   with an in concert nielsen   touted   lord of the violin   by bare chested posters   pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo clad mosh in front of the stage    nice touch    most of the scenes that follow   however   never top the opener       hysterical exceptions   the mentos and   baywatch   goofs      movie parodies are crammed in at an almost subliminal rate   but most are empty    when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la   anaconda   or baseball players disappear into a   field of dreams    esque cornfield   there s really nothing to laugh at    other moments   like an interlude in a fishing shop   are so unfocused that you re not sure what you re supposed to be laughing at    there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send ups here   so it s possible that director writer pat proft   by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two   guarantees something is sure to stick    and what does stick sticks well   particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard boiled dialogue   what those   naked gun   s   which proft collaborated on   did great   these bits are so on target that they allow you to remember   wrongfully accused   as an almost halfway there spoof instead of a lame brained failure    the movie might have been cursed to begin with   opening fast on the heels of   mafia       from proft colleague jim abrahams   and   baseketball     from proft colleague david zucker   but it s a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing   wrongfully accused   of being nielsen s funniest    
1499	1	there s some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn t and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did       lucky numbers   is a perfect example of this because it s such a blatant rip off of   fargo   and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me    i know i m in the minority here but let me explain    the film takes place in harrisburg   pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter    john travolta plays the local big shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards    russ is married to crystal   lisa kudrow     a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema    she s a selfish   nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl   not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market    crystal s cheating on russ with their collective boss dick   ed o neil     the tv station manager    she doesn t seem to genuinely like either of them   but it s all she can do in this one horse town    much like   fargo     this movie tells the story of a man who s going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick    he enlists the help of his english friend gig   tim roth     the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery    along the way a subplot involving a two bit thug named   accurately     dale the thug     michael rappaport   gets mixed up in the process    there s also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down    i m not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you re not expecting    this is a farce   which is basically a straightforward   adult oriented comedy but doesn t go as far as a classic black comedy should    where as   fargo   was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny     lucky numbers   is just funny because you can t take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously    it s all a big cartoon basically   but it s funny and i can respect that    travolta is great in his role and even though he s not a really likable character   he s trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he s a creep    he s like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill    crystal is just the opposite   she s constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself    kudrow is perfect in this role since she s spent 8 years on tv as the dim witted phoebe on   friends      here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe    i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money    like   jackie brown       an elmore leonard adaption     the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally    the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus    more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic   cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do    the ending itself is great    it s surprising and funny and makes you feel good    you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies  worth of stories into two hours  time and didn t fall apart   although many other critics might beg to differ      i liked it   and i could see it again   isn t that what makes a movie good    
1051	1	warning   contains what the matrix is    rated r for sci fi violence    starring   keanu reeves   laurence fishburne   joe panteliano  some may be disappointed with the matrix    i ll tell you i was    i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen    now wait wait   i know most of you loved it   and i m not saying i didn t like it    what i m saying is the first half was extremely slow    now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show    don t be fooled   this movie has a big story    and big chunks of talky moments    but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par   deserving the rating above    ok now to the story    well this may take a while    ok first of all   our world we live in now   is not the real world   actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix    a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out   when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world    he does so   and finds out that he can do anything   be anything he wants to be    but he has to fight a  matrix skipping  bad guy   who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him    laurence fishburne   his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves    but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were    yeah there were some in the first half but not enough    the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie    now for the second half   it is explosive   and saves the movie    some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking    the sound   the music   and all the effects were effective   and the last hour kept us entertained    but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes   this movie is at least 40 minutes too long    one would have wished for a better  matrix    but i do have to say   i did like it and i was entertained

1414	1	frequency n      the number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable   etc  don t worry    when watching the thriller frequency   you won t have to know what the heck frequency means    the premise   although it may sound complex   is very basic on the big screen    a new york cop   john     jim caviezel   finds a radio in his house   which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father   frank     dennis quaid   who died thirty years ago    immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse    when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasn t supposed to   the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past   they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john s mother and nine other women    it is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place       i told you that wasn t confusing        overall   i was very pleased with frequency    it s occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes    i usually don t buy those cheesy   i love you dad   segments in movies   but this one surprisingly satisfied me    maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative    frequency s creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended   what if    what would i do    would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated    or stop some kids from shooting other kids    or buy stock from yahoo         a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences      frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future    both share that   change the past slightly   and you ll change the future heavily   warning    the changes between the present and the past   such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs   are very similar    both are also wonderful feel good family films that can attract to a number of generations    the only difference worth noting is that frequency s final scene doesn t set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making    there are some problems with the film though    first   there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting   email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is      the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently   no pun intended   switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story    another problem is that the supporting cast   including noah emmerich and andre braugher   are underused    while in the film   which is not enough   the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in    frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the audience i saw it with who cheered at the end    even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you   like it almost did for me   check this movie out    you may be surprised as well

953	0	the film may be called mercury rising   but that title doesn t describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture   a routine thriller that combines government cover ups with a cloying and poorly motivated buddy story    the   hook   that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic    however   aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance   this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device    those expecting to see even a semi thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed    mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism    the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard  to swallow    i don t know whether the problem is in the original book   simple simon   or in the screenplay adaptation   but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible    once again   certain standby plot elements    the high level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent    are recycled   and not to good effect    while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood   this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense    the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold   art jeffries   bruce willis     is confronted with his own failure    unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time   he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death    the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9 year old simon lynch   miko hughes   when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player    soon   art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone    fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time   with the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player always just a step behind them    along the way   they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy   chi mcbride   and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest   kim dickens      why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player    apparently   the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra secret code called   mercury      to make sure it can t be cracked   they do the most intuitive thing possible   place a sample of it in a   nerds  puzzle magazine      of course   no one can solve it    no one except autistic simon   that is    when he calls the phone number listed in the solution   he gets the nsa    as a result   the cold hearted   sneering government man   alec baldwin   decides that simon has to be eliminated    for the good of the country   of course    but he hasn t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold   even though everyone in the audience has    it s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn t do anything exceptionally well   and does quite a few things rather poorly    for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like   mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time to time   but even the most exciting scenes   such as the one where art and simon are crouched down   avoiding passing trains   aren t that pulse pounding    the climactic struggle is a real ho hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness    overall   director harold becker is constantly struggling   and failing   to generate even a moment that isn t derivative or obligatory    bruce willis  star seems to be fading    this is his fourth straight lackluster outing   following last man standing   the fifth element   and the jackal    willis isn t terrible   but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through   and often does    alec baldwin   combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice   does some scenery  chewing   but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace    the film s real star is young miko hughes   heather langenkamp s son in wes craven s new nightmare     who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual   but is about 50 years younger    mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain   the replacement killers   and u   s   marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers    for those who like action and adventure in the theater   this has not been a good year    hopefully   the advent of summer will change that    until then   the best choices   for bruce willis or any other action hero   are on video    and   if you re determined to see mercury rising   check out the morning sky in early may    
980	0	anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon s fact based novel the king and i   and it s big   expensive and soulless    though good looking   its lavish sets   fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson s script    so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting    this is jodie foster s first movie since the jaw droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn t the best choice to show off her acting chops    she s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens   the uptight   widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam   now thailand   with her son to instruct the king s   chow yun fat   son in the ways of the west   because   the ways of england are the ways of the world      the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family   58 kids with 10 more in the way   impressive   no        the eldest prince is none too happy about this     father   have i offended you in some way    why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher       but soon gets to know anna and her stern  mother who loves you personality better and comes to like her    meanwhile   siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma    the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain s doing which arouses suspicion in siam   putting anna in an uncomfortable position    she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king s prejudices    he   though self righteous as ever   can t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly   quietly   develop affections for each other    there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king s younger daughters dies    it s your classic deathbed scene   with the girl s mournful eyes staring at her father   who tries only semi  successfully to maintain his composure    anna then comes in and cries a bit    the sequence was there for a purpose   to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer    i m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time   i was just sitting there   my emotions untouched    this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren    we never develop connections to the characters   never given a reason to care    this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant   whose last film was ever after   one of my favorites of 1998    i do not doubt tennant s ability to put together a decent movie   but anna and the king   aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient    the sets and scenery are gorgeous   but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur    even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from  75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia    we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view   there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger than life awe    i liked both foster and yun fat   who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles    foster s generally stoic persona serves her well here   as she is playing a reserved   formal and rather underdeveloped character    yun fat is especially effective   perfectly conveying the king of siam s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts    what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations    the cast is great   the director is talented   and the budget is lavish   but this ill advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole    this is an emotionless costume epic    
1780	1	i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean s war picture    i still think that   the bridge on the river kwai   doesn t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute s list of the 100 greatest american movies    and i think that   12 angry men       witness for the prosecution   and   paths of glory   would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957    but i can t deny the importance of   the bridge on the river kwai     cinematically and in its contents    the film is set in burma in 1943    a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai    but the british commanding officer   colonel nicholson   alec guinness     insists   corresponding to the geneva conventions   that his officers needn t work as simple workmen    struggling toughly   col   nicholson forces the japanese commandant   col   saito   sessue hayakawa     to give way in this respect    afterwards col   nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge    he considers it an opportunity to raise his men s morale   and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese    but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge   among them the american shears   william holden     an escapee from the japanese prison camp   and the british major warden   jack hawkins          a flaw of the picture is the clich   d characterization of the japanese people    they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british   as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge    and the film doesn t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in   paths of glory      lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies    this is also perceptible in the conversations between col   nicholson and col   saito    in this regard it is symptomatic that shears   who doubts the military logic   is presented as a somehow unpleasant person    the audience is supposed to applaud col   nicholson s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not    the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col   nicholson takes for his men       the plot by passes these risks      that means   the picture isn t perfect    but it has a lot of virtues as well       the bridge on the river kwai   shows the   madness   of war and what it can produce in people s minds    it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others   like shears   get cynics    and lean s film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests    these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti war film   despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme      david lean s direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect    his film is highly suspenseful   especially in its dramatic   if not wholly plausible   showdown    the film is also well photographed and has an apt score    alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col   nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character    the other actors deliver fine performances as well    i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses       c   karl rackwitz   klein k   ris   germany   1999    
969	0	the crown jewel of 1970 s irwin allen disaster movies   the poseidon adventure features an all star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship    the story begins on the u   s   s    poseidon s big new year s cruise   where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive    let s see   there s the new age preacher   hackman   who advises people to   pray to that part of god within yourself      there s the ex cop   borgnine   who busted a hooker   stella stevens   six times    then married her    there s the hippie singer     there s got to be a morning after           who turns to the company of a lonely man   red buttons   once her brother is killed    and to round out the group   the elderly couple   jack albertson and shelley winters   who live aboard the ship   the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall    we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure   before straight  faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship    everyone s in the giant ballroom at the time   shortly past midnight of the new year   when the ship turns first on its side   then completely upside down    the second  in command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives   but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship    in this case   because the ship is overturned   the top is the bottom    or is the bottom the top    either way   we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and    in the ballroom scene    christmas trees    thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors   through burning rooms   etc   while the ship slowly fills with water behind them    it s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting    the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at   with all the melodrama that comes in between the non thrilling action scenes    the one note in borgnine s one note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love   although since there isn t a sex scene   we never find out if his buttons really are red   and albertson and winters wonder if they ll live to see their grandson s birth    shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end   where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along    winters   who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie   stevens even not so  affectionately calls her   fatass   in one scene     finally finds her purpose       i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen     she brags   and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years   she s swimming through the water   her skirt billowing up around her hips   showing off her cellulite   or do you call it shellulite      ridden thighs    it s not so much funny as innately disgusting   which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole    
762	0	when considering david fincher s latest film     the game     four words come to mind       don t believe the hype      this michael douglas vehicle   from the director of   seven     isn t nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe    the film draws us in with an intriguing concept   aided no doubt by the riveting trailer   where a jaded millionaire   douglas   is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy    this isn t simply virtual reality    this is real life with a deadly twist    on his 48th birthday   nicholas van orton   douglas   is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother   conrad   sean penn      conrad has a special birthday present for his brother    he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services       they make your life fun     conrad tells him    nicholas humors his brother   telling him he ll call   but it s clear he has no time for any foolish     fantasy role playing     as he calls it    then   for reasons that are never really made clear   nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they re all about    he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process   which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have    nevertheless   when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client   the weird things start happening    of course   when we ve only covered about 30 minutes of screen time   what else should we expect    douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful   violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands    one of those films     basic instinct     came from the creative minds of writer   joe eszterhas and director   paul verhoeven    the premise of   the game     is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film     total recall      in that case   the premise was implanting someone else s memories as a way to enhance one s own life through a dream vacation    yet   in both films   the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience    we live the adventure along with the protagonist   reacting to each twist and turn    in theory   the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn t    all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride   when the truth is finally revealed    now   for those of you who forgot   let me say this again       don t believe the hype         the game   is not a thrilling roller coaster ride    as a suspense thriller   it doesn t do much but spin in circles    by the third reel   i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot    is it any wonder douglas won t be able to resist the charms of a mysterious   potentially life threatening blonde   ever heard of glenn close    no   well   how about sharon stone    thought so      if anything in this film surprises you at all   i would guess you haven t seen that many films    there is no suspense here    trust me   i looked hard to find some    i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations    fincher aim s for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas    there are those that might say   the game   is not intended to be viewed literally    i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film    the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues    there is a moment early in the film where van orton   realizing his game has begun   smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who s in on the whole thing    he is charged by his paranoia    he is looking at the world through new eyes    it is the last thought provoking moment in the film    from there on   the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us    any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device    at the outset   we re told each   game   is tailored to the individual    ultimately   this   game   is supposed to work like a crucible   trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire   proving his soul    yet   as douglas endures his personal gauntlet   we re given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is    i wanted to like this film more than i did    i look at it as just anothergreat idea   poorly realized    i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn t mean we were seeing what was really happening    bryan singer s   the usual suspects   for one   a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas    also   there is the underrated   jacob s ladder     with tim robbins   a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism    here are two examples of films that don t simply manipulate for manipulations  sake    there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place    one major issue that comes up in   the game   is whether or not the whole   illusion   is just a highly sophisticated con game    well   i can tell you right now   after you ve spent your  7 dollars   you may be asking yourself the same thing    
1910	1	i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live action disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins   separated at birth by divorcing parents   never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again    and everyone should know how i feel about remakes   especially of films i happen to enjoy   my fallacy   unless you re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both   just wrack your brain and come up with a   gasp   new idea      this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list   and was actually quite the opposite    contemporary live action disney films are not one of my favorties   anyway   they re usually unfunny   alienating   and a big fat bore   at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10    this one   however   is shockingly not bad    in fact   it s actually good    not the original good   but what s great about it is that it doesn t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining    because it s cute and innocent fun    because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with    because the lead star is immensely appealing    because the parents are also immensely appealing    and   i m repeating myself   because it s cute and innocent fun    there s nothing too risque about it   save the plot   the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish   but that is precisely the point of the movie     and it s aimed directly at either kids   adults who want to remember the original   or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid    i   personally   am somewhere between the second and third    i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn t so weird or diverse   the names godard and kubrick weren t even a glimmer in my right eye back then     when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc s   wonderful world of disney     where they d show you a live action and or made for tv disney flick an hour per week    i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films   like   lady and the tramp   and   pinnochio        and   most sadly   i remember every single christmas   without fail   there were a barage of children s animated half hour shows   made exclusively for the christmas season   that i wouldn t dare missing    i can even remember seeing the made for tv   parent trap ii   on tv one night   and after i had seen that one over and over and over again   i saw the original   parent trap      it s more of a late childhood movie   because it deals with the issue of divorce   but it deals with it in a disney ized version    it s playful   and witty   and charming   and if i saw it for the first time right now   having never experienced that part of my childhood   i d probably dismiss it    i d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn t seen the original at such a perfect age    watching it   i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film   and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly perfect parents splitting up   and how it affected my adolescence    and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke   and pointed out that even in the most fucked up of situations   things could always work out if you   well   manipulate things a bit   at least for the better    this new version did that for me   but it s also charming in its own way    it has a new cast   a contemporary feel   and   for the first time in awhile for a live action disney flick   a tone that isn t corny or condescending   but just right    the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way    and for the first time since the original film   the kids actually know better than the foolish adults    the story is basically classic by now   repeated almost as many times as kurosawa s   the seven samurai     a pair of twins   played here by lindsay lohan   just like they were played by hayley mills in the original   are separated at birth by their divorcing parents    one   annie   is sent to live with the mother   natasha richardson   resembling her mother   vanessa redgrave   more than i had ever noticed   in london   where she lives with her parents and her devoted   foppish butler   simon kunz     as she works as a swingin  fashion designer    she grows up refined and classy   but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker playing    the other   hallie   is sent to northern california with her father   dennis quaid   to live on a vineyard with their pseudo maid   lisa ann walter     and grows up rugged yet charming    they both meet at the same camp   one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged    they feud because they look all too similar   and are thus in tight competition   which results in some nasty pranks   which winds them in seclusion together in a private   out of the way cabin    there   they become friends   then learn about eachother    once they know everything   they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent   whom they ve only heard of    they learn about eachother s lives in detail   they make sure they look alike   which requires hair cutting and   notoriously   ear piercing   a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in   pulp fiction       and when the end of summer comes   they switch and hope for the best    lindsay lohan doesn t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original    but she comes off just as appealing as she did once    she does   though   add a couple new things   she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original   respectively    she also adds on an american and british accent to each one   with one faking the other accent throughout   and if you really take notice   you can see that the fake ones  accents aren t exactly perfect    she s also incredibly appealing   not merely cute   which is especially notable since this is her first feature film   and we know how notorious child actors are   especially in their first films    she makes a great protagonist   and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing    dennis quaid   in fact   hasn t been this likable in about a decade   his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past   not just that he s mr   meg ryan    ditto natasha richardson   except that she just hasn t ever been this likable period      the two make a winning couple   maybe not so winning as maureen o hara and the late brian keith in the original   but they still work for this film    instead of the bickering that ensued in the original   the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original   during the opening credits   we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2   where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother   and when back together again   the film s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental   but in that great way   not the migraine inducing way as in many such films    this all brings this new   parent trap   to a level of entertainment that hasn t really existed since   well   the original film years ago   still my money the best live action disney flick of all time    this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot   a gold digging sharon stone type   played by elaine hendrix   who s deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film   a treat instead of a bore    like the original   this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be   case in point     it takes two   starring the olsen twins   because it treats the children as the smart ones   and the adults as the silly ones   not the other way around    and because   above everything   it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew    however   in comparison with the original   it could be a bit better    certain scenes work well   but not nearly as well as they worked in the original    i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine   somehow   feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing   a lesson extracted from the howard hawks cary grant films of yesteryear    and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom   compared to the original   this film almost drowns in cutedom    the original   though not gritty   was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences    as such   this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film   but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect   and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances    
1385	1	i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x files    first   let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie    the producers are not stupid   making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable    you have to reach for a larger audience    therefore   the movie is quite user friendly    altough   non fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange    but fear not   duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on    you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera    in any case   the answer is no    i am not a fan of the x files   i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium    however   since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie    i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie   i am glad to report that i learned nothing new    everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others    i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie    warning   major spoilers follow    please do not read   to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming   what exactly is over that hill and what that weird   hummm   sound is all about    you have been warned    the x files is what a summer should be    exciting   scary   great special effects   unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary   and good performances    this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank    from start to finish   this movie does not let go of you    when i compare it with last summer s movies the best way to describe it would be   take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon    this flick is scary   not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes    in fact   the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue    you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd    the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid    you know   when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair   or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt    so yeah   the x files is scary    and guess what    you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed   computer generated   babyzilla   it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster    do not think that the x files is a monster movie    in fact   the creature is there for maybe three minutes total    no   the x files is definately a mulder episode of the series    scully is at his side   of course   but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time    she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny   but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much    no   this is mulder s time in the spotlight    by now   you have heard of the scene where mulder   showers   independence day    if you have not then i will not spoil it for you   let s just say that due to recent events mulder should be   showering   godzilla instead    to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there       who  cares      if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about    the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous    the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill    the script is spotless   every thing that happens happens for a purpose    if you are confused by something   do not worry because it will all become clear later on but   and i cannot stress this enough   pay attention        unlike most summer movies   the dialogue is twice as important as the effects    miss one vital piece of information and   like most people who talk during movies   you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense    also   to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies       don t    the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation    there is no time to take a breather between scenes because   again unlike most summer movies   godzilla anybody       the x files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots   every scene is crucial and serves a purpose    who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a   big emotional scene   between godzilla attacks    so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose    but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie   the x files is    what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited    cool effects    it s good some    pulse pounding    hell yes    strangely enough   i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non fans will have a good time    it does not provide answers to the show s many questions   the status quo remains nearly the same and   no   mulder and scully do not get together    rating   four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer   several jump right out of your seat thrills   many   whoah   i never saw that one coming      moments   four   holy shit   where the hell did that come from   and one heck of an ending    you may wonder where this movie lost half a star    well   i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck   the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop    it s pretty obvious the film s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time   but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving    
1485	1	earlier this year   the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics    a real charmer of a movie   it s possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience    now   at the end of 1998   comes waking ned devine   a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter    there s no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere    they strike all the same chords    but still   ned devine is a movie worth seeing    the plot is interesting and robust   the latest lottery winner is ned devine   jimmy keogh     of tullymore   ireland    ned s prize is over six million pounds   but the shock of winning killed the poor old man   and the check remains unclaimed    enter jackie o shea   ian bannen   and michael o sullivan   david kelly     the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village    the two men eventually find the ticket   and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he s actually ned   the entire town can reap the benefits   their only adversary is an ancient old woman   eileen dromey   who sees more profit in reporting the fraud    ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael    jackie   stocky and large   is the brains behind the operation   michael   scrawny and short   is the method man    the two contrast each other delightfully   and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience    every viewer is sure to like both of them    there are other minor subplots included as well   such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer    this appears quite inconsequential until the end   and even with a startling revelation it s a tad bit unnecessary    overall   waking ned devine has a predictable outcome   and plot twists are never really taken seriously    the ending   a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate   somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout    the kirk jones script is indeed off the cuff    in a way   waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents   warm   friendly   outgoing   and jovial    it s the perfect kind of comedy   a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes    there s nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two   because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one    indeed   it s one of the year s best feel good movies    91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss    
1517	1	not since 1996 s shine   which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott   has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world class musicians    in fact   if one were to watch these films together   it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills    yet hilary and jackie   the sophomore effort from director anand tucker   has something more to say    it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale    emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale   playing the sisters du pr      both musicians from childhood   hilary   griffiths   is renowned flutist while jacqueline   watson   is easily as skilled on the cello    the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women   both together and seperate    their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another s   and although their lives take very different paths    hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour    they are bound together by their deep family love    the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance    they contrast each other wonderfully   and while watson s portrayal of jackie du pr   is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic   both characters are charged with emotion    the frank cottrell boyce script   which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr     brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well    the script is also to be commended for its well polished dual nature    cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller   which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne s script for mission   impossible   and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame    the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least   and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story    some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised    nevertheless   hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around

1087	1	             minor plot spoilers in review                         no major spoilers are in review              the previous two   alien   films have each had their own unique styles to them    the ridley scott s alien was very much a stylistic suspense film    james cameron s aliens was much more of an action film    and i liked each film separately for which it was    now alien 3 is out    and it is it s own film in the same right that alien and aliens were    unlike aliens   alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens    this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off    the survivors of the expedition to lv 426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens    the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item   an egg    in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch   find its quarry   which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured   an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel    this vessel crash lands on fury 109    everyone in the vessel is killed   except ripley    the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash    fury 109 is an ex mining maximum security prison    when closed down   some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet    all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years    ripley s arrival sparks a problem with the inmates    as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner s sport   there is an infestation of lice on the planet    being an ex prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons    so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own    i will not go into detail   but you can guess what happens here    the alien is loose and no one believes ripley s outstanding story    she finds comfort in the arms of the colony s doctor    yes   after 57 years ripley has sex    it is not gratuitous   in fact   we don t even see them kiss   but it is just as well    a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film    there is a lot more gore in alien 3    in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two    it also sports a new alien with 4 legs    i won t say how   but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle   which i am sure will be explored in alien 4    sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character    her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination    the rest of the cast is also quite good    notably   charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109    alien 3 has a very distinct look    this is due largely to its director   david fincher    mr   fincher   who until now has only directed music videos and commercials   has done an incredible job here    his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no   alien   film has before    for mr   fincher   i see a long prosperous career ahead of him    the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry    elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the   alien   series been set in    this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii   james horner s aliens      this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring    this is a great score    the ending to alien 3 is quite good    there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up   but it played very nicely    i will not ruin the ending for you    go see the film    i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season    alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien    and when they make alien 4   perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in    
844	0	according to the publicity material   with this movie the directors   hope to restore good old fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness      hmm    you never know   they just might be on to something    what with the rise of geek chic   lounge music and seventies fashion   the ever contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own    but then   i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it    it s cheesy all right   but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch    that s a shame   because   in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more    woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise   roy munson    the movie opens in the fifties with roy s dad dishing out the reader s digest gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls   shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever    the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray   as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken    it s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good   he gives the wry   derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy    mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job   then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy s hand    then it s fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat   balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand    he s hopeless until he meets ishmael   randy quaid     an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege    so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno   picking up pretty hustler claudia   vanessa angel   on the way    with the exit of bill murray   the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go   and that s        dumb and dumber    yes   indeed   kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour   peter and bobby farrelly   the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle    so   prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands   distended nipples   ridiculous hair and bull semen    get set for stock fish out of water situations when city boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community   or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking   striptease and unchristian neighbour socking    now   don t get me wrong   there s nothing wrong with cheap humour   and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy    the trouble is that these jokes aren t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction    it lurches from sports movie to amish mocking to road trip to sentimental melodrama     pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal   and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack     never quite getting it all together    some gags fall flat from a lack of build up   while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don t do anything    why the long   unfunny fight in the car park    why two of these    why does that guy wear mascara   or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it    the film is full of these half thought through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer   grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying     wouldn t that be funny        well   no   actually    the actors don t do the movie much favours either    woody harrelson comes off okay   plausibly acting dumb   smart   cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it   but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham   and vanessa angel has no talent   like schwarzenegger   she seems more convincing playing a computer creation than a human    take the tv series weird science       please        even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie s climax    all in all   a fairly useless attempt at comedy   and a certified no hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance    we ll have to look to a reinspired john waters   or perhaps somebody from down under     strictly bowling     anyone     for the definitive bowling comedy    the flying inkpot s rating system     wait for the video         a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha           pretty good   bring a friend             amazing   potent stuff               perfection    see it twice

1008	1	apparently   director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film   american history x   i don t know the details of the fight   but it seems that he is not happy with the final product   and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether    i ve heard about this kind of thing happening before   and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce    as it is   i found american history x to be an extremely good film   not just because of tony kaye s focused look at the touchy subject of racism   but because of a powerful   charismatic performance from edward norton    it s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton s fantastic role in primal fear   but   here he is now   starring in his own film and making himself a star    norton is one of those performers who becomes his character   and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year    he plays a young man named derek vinyard   a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother   danny   edward furlong     mother   beverly d angelo     and sister   davin   jennifer lien      the film opens with a flashback   in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car    we find out that this lands him in prison   and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny    in the present time of the film   danny is in high school   and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother    much of the film is told in flashback   and we see the path that leads to derek s adoption of white supremacy    when derek is released   having served three years in prison   he finds that his brother is now a full blown skinhead   derek   however   has given up the violence   and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things    what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid   thoughtless people    they are intelligent and articulate   and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms    it s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach   but kaye has found the right note for his material    because american history x is a mainstream film   there has to be a redemption phase for our main character    some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic    i partially disagree with this   because   although i do not advocate racism in any way   it s interesting the way kaye presents derek    he is a loud   obnoxious man   but he s also very smart    the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable    his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men    it s clear that he s passionate about his beliefs   and that he s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up    of course   it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part    it s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest    in addition to getting the look just right   he s perfect for this role    derek requires intelligence   depth   and a whole lot of shouting   and norton does it all with ease    even when he s at his meanest   derek has a likable quality to him   and that s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead    what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny s school   avery brooks   becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny    the other performances are all terrific   with standouts from furlong   d angelo   and lien    visually   the film is very powerful    kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices   and most of them work nicely    lots of slow motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere    but   like a lot of movies lately   american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes    although the climactic scene is very moving   the picture ends with a pretentious   preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed    for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point   it felt like a slap in the face to be hand fed a theme in such a simplistic way    it makes me wonder what   exactly   tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film    perhaps this last scene was the problem    it s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good    in a time when so many movies are timid and weak   american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way    
422	0	plot   something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non horror movies    oh yeah   there s also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit   but trust me   you won t care much about the   plot   in this film        critique   parody movies either work or they don t and this one just doesn t work    the laughs aren t as pronounced this time around   the energy level   the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here    it s like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something   wink   wink      and the scariest part of it all    check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy   seven    i say again   it took seven people to write 82 minutes worth of fart jokes   half assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror    now i m not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed   funny sketch   ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves   but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on   saturday night live      there are a couple of funny one liners   but mostly just rehashed one joke scenes   a lot of dead silence and lame gags    add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here   the film s website isn t even up yet        what the f                  i do however have to give it up to james woods   the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all   the exorcist take off   miss this and you ve missed any reason to see the flick      i especially liked his one liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman s head turning    very funny    unfortunately   the film plummets straight down after that   with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude   where s my car   and other action movies like charlie s angels and mission impossible 2   now help me figure this one out   will you    isn t this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies           or maybe that s just the title of the film f ing with my head      well   i m sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame ass script    the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers   money   instead of the zucker brothers   comedy   for this sequel    unfortunately for us   all we re left with here is a skeleton of a film which might ve been funny   had it been worked over a few more times   tightened up here and there   and been injected with more solid laughs    but as things stand now   there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year s film has led everyone down this path   so screw them for not trying as hard   critically speaking   of course      you should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough   real   effort into this chop job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents    pooh on you       that s telling  em   joblo    sheesh    btw   i m allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson   whose massive breasts and skanky g string had me chompin  at the bit    you go   girl    everyone else       stay    where s joblo coming from    airplane   10 10     airplane ii   10 10     galaxy quest   8 10     hannibal   7 10     the haunting   3 10     mafia   5 10     naked gun   8 10     scary movie   8 10     top secret   9 10    
751	0	the general s daughter is a heartless   absurd film   a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters    director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham handed obscenity   creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo depth    what s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic    the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm    john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess   playing warrant officer paul brenner   brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell   leslie stefanson     daughter of general joe campbell   james cromwell      brenner is teamed up with ex spouse sarah sunderland   madeline stowe     and they check out all the suspects on the base   including elizabeth s mentor   colonel moore   james woods      soon   it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff   but the question comes down to why    and   of course   who    ebert s law of the economy of characters can be applied here   one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point   including the two protagonists     but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story    perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that   but it s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something    on a story level   the general s daughter is ineptly constructed    the film   adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille s novel   which was apparently based on a true story     plods along to its conclusion   filling in the blanks with stale   unrealistic dialogue and   shocking   plot developments    having not read the novel   it s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author   but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree    scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity   minutes after finding the dead young woman   brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue   which includes endless strings of forced lines       sunderland actually asks brenner     why was she killed      to which i would have answered     if i knew   then the movie would already be over        only after we ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together   this angle   though apparently present to develop their characters   is never explored    not that it really matters   since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot    in one scene   sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask    she sees one of his rings   and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring    instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect   they take him to brenner s houseboat   beat him up   and pour hot coffee in his lap    this scene really pushed me over the edge   not because it s gratuitous and mean spirited   but because it illustrates the film s complete disregard for the characters and the audience    it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene   mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise    i realized that these constructs on screen aren t actually characters   but devices present only to serve the story    this would have been bad enough without the west s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct    compelling films about sexual crimes don t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks   and they certainly don t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture    these scenes are not the least bit powerful   on the contrary   they re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain   whomever that may turn out to be    in addition   the movie treats sexual fetishes    and sadomasochism in particular    as if it s a perversion of everything we know to be pure    this standpoint is certainly allowed   but only in accompaniment with well developed themes to back it up    as it is   the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes   and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane    perhaps the only positive elements in the general s daughter are a couple of the performances    james woods has a few terrific scenes   and plays his role with sharp   witty subtlety    i also liked james cromwell   mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous    nonetheless   these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary   obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization    the general s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film    it pretends to have a soul   to be of strict moral code   when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut outs force feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one sided moral judgments    
1199	1	damn those trailers    had it not been for the advertising of this film   which reveals far too much about its contents   i would have been glued to  under the sand     as it is   the film retains some value   thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling   and a more mature francois ozon in the director s chair    marie   charlotte rampling   and her husband jean   bruno cremer   lounge on the beach    she takes a nap while he goes for a swim    when marie wakes up   jean is nowhere to be found    she contacts authorities   but they can t find him either    did he disappear to start a new life    was he killed by accident    did he commit suicide    marie still asks herself these questions a year later   and in order to move on with her life   she must find some answers    it s a fine premise   and this little movie uses it to the limit    the film moves at a leisurely pace   a bit slow   but relaxing    it s a very visual story   and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles    this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie   who shot the film in a dreamy haze   and the lead performance by rampling    rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie   you connect with her character instantly   despite that she s delusional    the scenes where she interacts with her husband   who she still believes is alive   are heartbreaking    she can t quite get over him    they ve been married for twenty five years    the other actors   particularly jacques nolot   are excellent too    the sex in the film is rather unneeded   but compared to ozon s  criminal lovers    it s the disney channel    likely to cause some discussion afterwards    under the sand  is a fine movie going experience    while it s hard to recommend as entertainment   it s a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss    ozon seems to ask what you would do   and that s certainly a hard question to answer    
947	0	perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with         this is the fake news     norm macdonald   at times   could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi offensive phrases in his raspy voice   coated with a condescending attitude    his shtick was marked by crassness    in this movie   for example   when his girlfriend says that she s kicking him out because he s been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months   he tries to calm the situation by saying     maybe you ll feel better after we have some dirty sex      this kind of humor can only go so far   but certainly can t go the distance in a full length feature       dirty work     is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically    emotionally   they ve never outgrown their pubescent years   which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback    although having no apparent real world skills   the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people    if the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket   then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart    mitch   norm macdonald   and sam   artie lange   need to come up with  50   000 in a period of two weeks so that sam s dad   jack warden   can have a heart operation    their idea is to start a revenge for hire business where they ll do your dirty work    in the funniest scene   and possibly the only funny scene   of the movie   they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot    their presence is established   but when a less than honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment   the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge    by default   dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots   but it delivers jerky boys level material    except for the bit at the used car lot   and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers     the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call    already weak on material   it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs  broads  and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction    but what s really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor    relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying   note to self       note to self   learn to fight     he says after getting beat up     note to self   there s always beer     he says after hitting rock bottom   etc       we feel like we re just watching an elongated rehash of his not so glorious days on saturday night live    much like the television show   for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits    the rest of the story is just dead space    
891	0	some movies  pre release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they re finally released   everyone just goes along with it    thus sometimes   films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations    last year it was the thin red line    this year s   winner   is the hurricane   pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool    acclaimed director norman jewison s biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun    and that s supposed to be ok because   see   it s a true story    it s about rubin   hurricane   carter   denzel washington     a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly   racist      detective   dan hedaya   who s had it in for the   big shot   hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife   in self defense but who cares   right      when rubin was only ten    he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole    most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison    to the rescue    lesra martin   vicellous reon shannon   and his team of wanna be detectives    lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well off canadian white people   hanna   unger   schreiber   to get an education    lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book      the sixteenth round     rubin s autobiography    immediately thereafter   schreiber s character tells lesra   sometimes we don t pick the books we read   they pick us      hmmm    after a few visits to the prison   they become convinced of rubin s innocence and launch their own full scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him    they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses   i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces     and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane s innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings    of course   we re already told that he s innocent    a movie like this is especially frustrating because we re not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life    all too obviously   we re getting the hollywood watered  down version    that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it    it s almost cruel    the melodrama isn t of the entertaining kind either   it s the hokey   rammed down your throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity    witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo saintliness of our four protagonists    the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it s a no frills courtroom movie    it s formula stripped to the bare necessities    you have your wrongly accused black man    you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene    but there s nothing else    you d expect some sort of involving investigation    but that s not necessary since we re implicitly informed of his innocence    thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding    brooding to himself    brooding to other inmates    brooding to lesra    brooding to lesra s canadian friends    brooding in letters    i don t think i ll ever look at brooding the same way again    it wasn t long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane s exceedingly deep meditations on his condition    i wanted something to happen    as for washington s performance in the title role    i figured i d have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it s received    he is top notch   though still boring    how is that possible    well   he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly    unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap    what a waste of a great performer    speaking of wastes   why the hell did john hannah agree to do this    he s an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly   but what is he doing here    to call his character   along with schreiber s and unger s   a stick figure would be a gross understatement    all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas   as benevolent as do gooders come    if they re to play a major part in this movie   why not make them real people   with real feelings and emotions    look   if you re going to make a formula movie   don t undermine the formula    courtroom dramas can be fun   but this is ridiculous    not only is it trite   it s boring    
1521	1	many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come   the new film by visionary director vincent ward    most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors    but little do they know   as i so plainly found out   that this has quite a complex story to tell    walking out of the theater   i could see the audience s disgust        one member even had to be awakened after the film ended    don t believe the previews that you see        this is definitely not a film for everyone    this is quite possibly one of the most adult oriented films to come out in recent years    kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline    the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us    it goes back and forth in time   as if it has no boundaries    think of the film city of angels    now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision    both films deal with the afterlife   but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office    costing around  85 million to make   the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it s money back    but due to it s story   i doubt it will    for everyone who thought titanic s story was too simple and cliche   here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay   it may not have done nearly as well    but don t get me wrong        i hope the film does do well    it s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen    i doubt most of us could have thought of this place   even in our own mind    what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals    the only film that surpasses it is dark city    full of rich   shocking colors   we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to    but don t do that   because you ll end up going to hell    what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake    chris   christy   nielsen   robin williams   is startled by the sudden jolt   but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat    annie   annabella sciorra   spies chris   as well   and both eventually bond and get married    annie is an artist   whose paintings are colorful   lush   and surrealistic    chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself    they also have two children   marie   jessica brooks   and ian   josh paddock      but one day   the two children are killed in a car crash   and it almost destroys annie    she tries to commit suicide   but fails   and is then put in an institution    chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren t around anymore   and nothing will change that    just as annie gets her life back in order   chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim    chris goes to heaven   or his version of heaven   rather    guided by albert   cuba gooding   jr       chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy    that is   until he realizes how miserable he is without annie    prior to heaven   he would try to comfort annie   but the more he was around   the more pain she felt    chris decides to leave her alone    little does he realize what will happen next    i m not about to say   because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story   many critics   however   give it away      certainly   chris dying is crucial to the plot   but they tell you that he dies in the previews    story is not necessarily important for this movie to work   because it deals with the afterlife    however   strangely   virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil    a couple of comments here and there   but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life       we re soul mates      chris exclaims    heaven   in movies   is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white   purity   and love    usually   it also looks like it rests among the clouds    but what dreams may come goes a different route    it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before    chris  heaven is his memories brought to life    his thoughts can make anything real   and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven       i ve never seen anyone use real paint before     albert says    equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone    instead   it s a state of being    in one gloriously horrific scene   chris and his   tracker     max von sydow   arrive at a sea of faces    thousands of heads are stuck above ground   their bodies somewhere else    mostly dead silent   some quips are made   almost as if to lighten the mood    it s truly a frightening sequence    production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination    using state of the art computer technology   worlds are created for exploration    sometimes   some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact    it s not necessary to be there   but we appreciate seeing it    costume designer yvonne blake   who also appears in the film   has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes    cinematographer eduardo serra   whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove   has a difficult job   as most cinematographers do working with special effects    but serra s entire universe is a computer generated image   and he does a masterful job    writer ron bass   adapting from the novel by richard matheson   provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot    the story is extremely vague in its details   allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning    and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision    what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience    your average movie goer more than likely isn t used to expressionistic techniques    the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people   but they shouldn t take it too far    it is   after all   just a movie    robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances   while his comedic roles have been suffering    his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff   but when is confined by a screenplay   he isn t quite as effective    but drama is really his strong point   and you can see that here    it s doubtful he ll get another oscar nomination   but i wouldn t really mind if he did    the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land    this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention    it s also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination    however   the academy doesn t like to award performances for these types of films    cuba gooding   jr   has been better   but he s certainly not distracting    max von sydow is underused   as are jessica brooks and josh paddock    a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear   if they even recognize him   as chris  father lost in the sea of faces    it s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film   considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images    overall   it s williams and sciorra s film    what dreams may come is rated pg 13 for thematic elements involving death   some disturbing images   language   and some partial nudity    the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience    some will find the plot distracting    some will find the visuals absolutely glorious    and some will find both    the only real problem with the film   that i could see   was that it slows down considerably during the midsection   just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins    by the way   some controversy even surrounded the title   which was mistaken for a sexual term     what   becomes   wet   and you should understand      in actuality   the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet    just thought i should let you know

1554	1	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    like its own opening shot   from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity   persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent    a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry   boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking    the film follows a soft spoken young man   eddie adams   mark wahlberg   from torrance   through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom   and later   to a harrowingly precipitous drop    as boogie nights opens   he s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub   and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity    recruited by fatherly jack horner   a rejuvenated burt reynolds     a successful porn filmmaker   eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler   pornstar    wholeheartedly embraced by jack s troupe   including the maternal amber waves   julianne moore     reed rothchild   john c   reilly     buck swope   don cheadle     rollergirl   heather graham     dirk and his   one special thing   are quickly propelled to the top of his field   fulfilling his mantra of being a   big bright shining star      his lack of discipline   however   incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in    the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr   anderson   whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious    from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool   mr   anderson s accomplished command of the camera is without question    while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating   impertinent and self congratulatory   case in point   marc rocco s unforgettable perpetual motion helming of murder in the first     in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr   anderson   be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp   is purposeful and potent    it s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker s career    boogie nights is only his second feature film   following up his debut feature from earlier this year   hard eight    and although it s somewhat derivative   his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman   while in terms of visuals he s clearly influenced by martin scorsese     at least he s borrowing from some of the best   and it s entirely effective within the context of this film    while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective   in terms of sheer entertainment value it s also rollicking good fun   with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour    the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music   clothes   hairstyles   dance   idioms   and culture   aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges   and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent   pre aids scare period in american history where uninhibited   free wheeling lifestyles abounded    while much of the film s humour pertains to the characters  obliviousness of now outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society    a prime example is part time salesman buck swope s demo of a stereo system with an eight track tape   and inviting a prospective customer to get  freaky deaky  with the music    it s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule   but of wistful reminiscence   and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous    a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny   to be sure   but oddly magical   and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie dirk s bedroom   completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures   farrah fawcett   cheryl tiegs   bruce lee   is breathtaking    ably supported by a well selected collection of period music   all of which purportedly came straight from mr   anderson s personal collection     there s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights    it s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline   the film s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters    after the debacle with 1996 s milos forman film   the people vs    larry flynt   another finely crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography related storyline   the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public    however   while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago   it s hardly a lurid or seamy film    given the subject matter   there s very little nudity   and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous    and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality   but simply as a business    the glimpses on the sets of jack horner s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate   there s a candid matter of factness in terms of sex   his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job   and it s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking   such as coercion or debauchery   are avoided    if anything   boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves    jack horner s dream is an honourable one    he genuinely aspires to make a great film    and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood   albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence      in both films   the world of quickie low budget filmmaking is explored   and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton   scott alexander   and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets    jack s retort of   there are shadows in light   baby   to his cinematographer s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood s   it s not about the little details   it s about the big picture      rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false    in boogie nights and ed wood   the aspirations of the respective filmmakers  prove to be bemusing   not in their intentions    there s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an  artistic  erotic picture    but in the degree that they miss the mark    much like the humour lacing ed wood   the laughs involving jack horner are double edged   after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres   when jack breathes   this is the best work i ve ever done     it s genuinely funny   but given his utter sincerity   also possesses a tinge of sadness    mr   anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter    while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging   there really isn t any clever dialogue in the film   though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges   when one considers that the film s   protagonist   literally doesn t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time   it s no wonder why the playfully inane   how much can you bench      banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film s finest exchanges    and while mr   anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters   it s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film s characters are simply stale material    julianne moore s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff   better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv movie version of her character s story   and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions    still   even if he doesn t always know what to do with his characters   mr   anderson most definitely captures their essences   and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious    misguided   even aimless   hopelessly naive   self destructive   insufferable   i loved them just the same    in any case   it s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired   and ultimately best executed   scenes of the year   a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson   a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance   even if it s a small one   in a suicidal drug deal scam   only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric   the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger s   sister christian   on his stereo system is sheer brilliance   flanked by an armed bodyguard    if this scene already wasn t tense enough with these elements   mr   anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene   who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room   pushing the scene to a new   surreal level of delightful giddiness    there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights    mr   anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight   here   it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect    similarly   a painful scene where crew member scotty j   philip seymour hoffman   breaks down in tears in the driver s seat   sobbing   i m so stupid   after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening    boogie nights is exceedingly well cast   and each of the actors rise to the occasion   the ensemble cast is uniformly good    while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr   wahlberg   fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films   and mr   reynolds   terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film   ringing true in every respect     a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention    mr   reilly demonstrates here   as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard s georgia   a genuine aptitude for comedy    many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film    i m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot   but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee    mr   reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number   and it s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation    worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad   and dead on period   it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me   demo track   you got the touch   in a vain attempt at a musical career    mr   reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective    ms   graham   with her long dirty blonde hair   innocent demeanour   and huge hazel eyes   looks like a disney animated heroine come to life    or in this case   a disney animated heroine who came to life   made a wrong turn   and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s   early 80s adult film industry    consequently   it s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates   but in a scene where she s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets   garish red lipstick messily smeared on   giving the camera a hilariously pouty come hither look   all one can do is gulp    her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out   err    in a figurative sense      she s essentially a glorified extra    but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity       if only mr   anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face   though      and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish   as a teen   ms   graham s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers   since then   her most notable roles have been as a junkie   gus van sant s drugstore cowboy   and now a porn starlet    draw your own conclusions    perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr   cheadle   who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity   and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion    his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st   vincent   an interesting melora walters   is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness   and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible   it s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry    while the scenario is familiar   the wounded look in cheadle s eyes makes the scene unforgettable    luis guzman s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma s carlito s way   and here he plays a variation on the same character   maurice t   rodriguez is a hapless but good natured nightclub owner who s a hanger on to jack s group   ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack   with little disguise made of his desperation   for a part in one of his erotic pictures    jack s eventual acquiescence to maurice s request leads to one of boogie nights  biggest comic payoffs    boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr   anderson   who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work    striking a fine balance between humour and drama   and exceptionally well crafted   there s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year    
1951	1	steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back   he spent this time writing essays and short stories for   the new yorker     several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation   pure drivel   1998      much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery   although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview   in a fine chapter called   in search of the wily filipino      now   as writer and star of bowfinger   he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema   perhaps finally venting the frustrations    everything being made now is crap    that led to his brief retirement from hollywood    martin stars as bobby bowfinger   a roger corman wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer   quality of the projects be damned    his accountant   adam alexi malle   proposes a movie called   chubby rain     about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops    bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately   and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film   based on the lie that america s top box office draw   kit ramsey   murphy     has agreed to star    ramsey   of course   wants nothing to do with such low grade material   so bowfinger   on the thinking that action stars need to run   not speak   decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously    he sends his cast members   who aren t in on it   either   they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co stars   to ramsey s table at restaurants   asks them to follow him in parking lots   etc     spouting script dialogue   all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance    the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time    ramsey is a member of mind head   a cultish self help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities       as if that s not familiar enough   mind head guru terry stricter   terence stamp   has been dressed and combed to resemble l   ron hubbard   founder of scientology      when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble   white code   in his face   they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat   requiring bowfinger to find a stand in    murphy will probably win more fans as jiff   ramsey s adorable   ignoramus double   than as kit   but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage    always surrounded by an entourage   suffering from a racial inferiority complex   murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself    furthermore   consider the enemies he ll make of popular scientologists    pacing stricter s neutral coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer   ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly    murphy s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta   clearing      not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick   bowfinger is steve martin s invention    his script is surprisingly clever as satire   given that the pseudo religion is a sitting duck   as is the entire los angeles film industry       the griffin mill types take quite a beating   in the form of robert downey jr   as bigwig jerry renfro      martin s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture    as expected   there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs   such as martin s crew of mexican border jumpers   who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading   cahiers du cinema     or martin s nonsensical explanation to dave   his loyal cinematographer   jamie kennedy     that every movie   in the end   has a budget of two thousand dollars          most of bowfinger is universally funny   however   i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski   one of our brightest comediennes   is on screen    bowfinger s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath    we re also asked to believe that a few simple close ups of kit ramsey would redeem   chubby rain     z grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush       this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz s last directorial effort   the poorly conceived in   out      these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece    as i mentioned at the start of this review   bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham s character daisy does   hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom    that said   it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus   the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome    martin gets sentimental by story s end as he did in l   a   story   and how could he not    for those who can hack it   the movies might be the greatest business in the world    
1002	1	films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success   whether they re about superheroes   batman   superman   spawn     or geared toward kids   casper   or the arthouse crowd   ghost world     but there s never really been a comic book like from hell before    for starters   it was created by alan moore   and eddie campbell     who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid  80s with a 12 part series called the watchmen    to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd    the book   or   graphic novel     if you will   is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes    in other words   don t dismiss this film because of its source    if you can get past the whole comic book thing   you might find another stumbling block in from hell s directors   albert and allen hughes    getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in   well   anything   but riddle me this   who better to direct a film that s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society    the ghetto in question is   of course   whitechapel in 1888 london s east end    it s a filthy   sooty place where the whores   called   unfortunates     are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision    when the first stiff turns up   copper peter godley   robbie coltrane   the world is not enough   calls in inspector frederick abberline   johnny depp   blow   to crack the case    abberline   a widower   has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium    upon arriving in whitechapel   he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly   heather graham   say it isn t so   and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can t stomach    i don t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper   so i won t go into the particulars here   other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay    in the comic   they don t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper   but screenwriters terry hayes   vertical limit   and rafael yglesias   les mis   rables   do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end    it s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because   after all   an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts    and from hell s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days     who holds back the electric car who made steve guttenberg a star          don t worry   it ll all make sense when you see it    now onto from hell s appearance   it s certainly dark and bleak enough   and it s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did   at times   it seems like sleepy hollow 2      the print i saw wasn t completely finished   both color and music had not been finalized   so no comments about marilyn manson     but cinematographer peter deming   don t say a word   ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks   even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic    oscar winner martin childs    shakespeare in love   production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place    even the acting in from hell is solid   with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent    ians holm   joe gould s secret   and richardson   102 dalmatians   log in great supporting roles   but the big surprise here is graham    i cringed the first time she opened her mouth   imagining her attempt at an irish accent   but it actually wasn t half bad    the film   however   is all good    2   00   r for strong violence gore   sexuality   language and drug content

1264	1	on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements   in case you missed it   warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail    he says to a black congregation         if you can t cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife   you re never gonna get rid of me        well   there is such a plot   and it works very well in this comedy    beatty plays jay billington bulworth   a long time democratic senator from california    the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth s latest commercials condemning affirmative action    the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy    when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv   having gone without food or sleep for days    his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care    first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe   a  10 million life insurance policy in his daughter s name    then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination    his assistant murphy   oliver platt   is oblivious to bulworth s suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements    bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african american church   then takes questions from the audience    he is hit hard with questions about his voting record    he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots   and it hasn t shown up    since he s a dead man anyway   he figures he ll answer truthfully   he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l   a   for the photo opportunity    they made some promises that improved their public image for a while   and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made    the shock and outrage from the congregation grows   the questions keep coming   and he keeps shooting back honest   if ugly   answers       before i go further   i d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make   and that is that characterizing african americans as malt liquor drinking o   j    fans is not part of bulworth s   truth      that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie    when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics   this line is not what they re talking about      the experience is liberating    with nothing left to lose   bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth    he can say whatever he wants because he s going to be dead anyway    why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician   that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists   and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism    bulworth s candor wins him three volunteers from the church   one of whom   nikki   halle barry     he gets a crush on    he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something    chicken wings   appropriately enough    bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives    when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings   bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment    with so much money and so many talented people working so hard   he wonders   why can t hollywood make a quality product       you go   warren      when they become indignant and ask why he s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product   he callously admits that it s because they are rich jews    that night he drops the three african american volunteers at their nightclub   and he decides to go in with them    he stays up all night drinking   smoking pot   dancing   falling in love with nikki   and learning to scratch turntables and rap    the next day   he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit and tie fundraisers    from then on   at all of his political appearances   he raps his political truth    his rap is not bad for a middle aged white guy    he s not very good   but it is his first try and at least he s not embarrassingly bad    his lobbyists are not amused   but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth    eventually   the movie s plot   remember he hired a hit man      overtakes the politics   which is too bad    screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him    there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes   bulworth fleeing his killer    these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along   but it distracted and detracted from bulworth s political ranting   which was much more interesting than the ever present   obvious looking assassin    still   most of the movie is original and very enjoyable   and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen    as the story and screen writer   he came up first with a good structure   then with good dialogue to back it up   jeremy pikser co wrote the screenplay      as an actor   he was able to convincingly portray bulworth s depression   then liberation and rebirth    as a producer   there were four others   he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood s indulgent formulas   except for those inexcusable chase scenes      someone else probably could have directed   but since he was there anyway   what the heck    it s too bad that there aren t more movies like this around   movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics    after all   much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news    just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants    just don t expect to be popular with the insurance companies    
90	0	the first film produced by adam sandler s happy madison production company   clever title eh     is essentially a one joke movie   much like the movies sandler stars in himself    however the difference here is that this one joke just isn t very funny    rob schneider stars as the title character   a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a   man whore   to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client s custom made fish tank   which deuce destroyed while staying in his home    deuce goes on numerous   dates     and each woman he goes out with has a   humorous   quirk about herself    one has narcolepsy   one has tourette s syndrome   one is a man        etc   etc    my problem is that we see all of these women in the film s trailer   so why do i need to watch the movie    seen the trailer        seen the film    only a quick cameo from norm macdonald   and a follow up joke during the closing credits   generates any chuckles    deuce bigalow   male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video   a division of di ney      the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1   85   1   and features the original theatrical trailer   as well as trailers for mystery alaska   happy texas   and outside providence     an extremely brief production featurette   which contains footage not used in the film     and storyboard to scene comparisons    yep   you read that right        there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd    two scenes are storyboarded        neither of which are particularly exciting    there are fight scenes in this movie   so why aren t we seeing storyboards of those segments   especially the parody moments from the matrix      i wonder what s funnier   the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di ney thought fans of this film would want to see them    deleted scenes    sure    audio commentary    you betcha    but storyboards    come on     r   
848	0	capsule   the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith s films gets their own movie    the gags are sporadically funny    it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti gay jokes    the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team    the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film    sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching    this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night       and it turns out he had very good reasons         low 0    4 to  4    a film needs a plot    it needs characters for empathy value    it needs a story and an emotional center    if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are    kevin smith has now made two satisfying films   clerks and chasing amy    with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp    peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled    but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith s fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it    his remaining two films   mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience    jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes   penis jokes   flatulence jokes   film pastiches   and in jokes    how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call    for me   the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny    there was not enough cleverness or variety    it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay    penis jokes work only so many times    showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags    they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford   the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post war films including dead of night   the lady vanishes   and passport to pimlico    jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners    as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts    in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads    jay and silent bob   played by jason mewes and kevin smith   are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks    this leaves them at loose ends    they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie    they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash    so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way    the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood  the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny    silent bob   being silent   can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his    this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have    jay has to be the comic    he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive    the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny    he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair    so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team    their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before  sometimes just minutes before    like dogma before it   but definitely not like chasing amy   this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie    certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving    they are excuses for gags   many of which still fall flat    it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content    the film does not offer much to an adult audience    i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the  4 to  4 scale

599	0	for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo   the killer   hard boiled   face off   appears to have made an exciting   elegant   charming spy thriller   kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american   read   unsophisticated   hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them    sadly   as the picture progresses   the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up   two hour long episode of magyuver    and not a particularly good one at that    what went wrong    mi2 begins flashily enough   that initial flash leading us to believe that it ll soon give way to something of a plot   but it only gives way to more flash   then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise s firing gun just so they can die really cool    early on   during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt   tom cruise   and nyah nordoff hall   thandie newton     woo works some of his trademark magic    in one hypnotic   though completely inexplicable sequence   the director slows the action down to a languid semi stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other s eyes with come hither sexuality       just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance   coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff    prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain   sans scaffolding   then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another    why    i haven t the foggiest    i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply    with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine   the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects    it s possible that these   spies   could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off   though of course this is never explored    the scenes i ve described are really only included to titillate   not to give any insight into character    god forbid    woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic   but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial like visuals    still in terms of crackerjack eye candy   the opening has much to cherish    cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices   the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is      between the frantic dancing   woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact    the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way   yet it has style and something of soul   and woo casts a bit of a spell on us    sure it s all smoke and mirrors   but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product    thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez   george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight    they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres    newton bats her eyes flirtatiously    cruise grins a little too slyly    the cruise character   ethan hunt   has been drastically altered since the first film    here cruise plays him more as a hip   sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1    he s cool and dashing   which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut   which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film     and blustered his way through magnolia   quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90 s      sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise s initial   i m the man      charm and more slo mo close ups of his preening mug    mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act   which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won t stop    the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle   the first gun fight in the film     which really should be unheard of in a john woo film   but alas this particular battle could ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi   of course excepting the   symbolic   pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture      we ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand    it isn t done any differently here    the action is pure hard target   broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind    he s cool for sure but he s made to be as empty as the movie    the actor isn t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks   he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment   be it during a gunfight   before one or after one    when he s not beaming away   he s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell   but woo s editing seriously undermines the effort    he fetishizes cruise s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof    i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he s really austin powers    in a classic woo action moment   ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin up boy angel of death    the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual   one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise   basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does      the lead bad guy   played by the appropriately british dougray scott   and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken       on motorcycles    though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment   the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug   only to fly about a hundred feet   still in bear hug position     land on a beach below and begin a mano e mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a   so you thought i was dead            not to worry   cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat    what a hero    you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2 s plot    my reasoning is simple   i m not sure of any good it would do    the film itself has absolutely no concern with story   only with hurtling forth to the next   special   effect    i wasn t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video    nobody will go to this for the plot   and if they do they ll surely regret it    as summer movies evolve   or devolve   character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing    in mi   the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma s   that film s director   stylistic flourishes   while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo s non stop masturbatory pandemonium    it s irrelevant in every sense   as is character    all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors

429	0	   mandingo   has traditionally been seen as one of two things   either a much needed revisionist look at slavery in the south   or in the words of film critic leonard maltin     a trashy potboiler   that   appeals only to the s m crowd      actually   i think   mandingo   is a strange combination of the two   although it fails on both fronts    it s too trashy to be good drama   but too dramatic to be good trash    the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell   james mason   and his son   hammond   perry king      one day in new orleans   hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede   heavyweight boxer ken norton      although the movie never explains it   a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley    according to the movie   mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves    hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him    hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves    meanwhile   hammond has married his cousin   blanche   susan george     because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild    hammond   however   is happier spending nights with his   bed wench     the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex    it is quickly apparent that hammond   despite his overt racism   is more in love with his bed wench   a sensitive slave girl named ellen   brenda sykes     than he is with blanche    hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had   pleasured   her before he did    of course   it s fine that he s slept with numerous slave girls   but the fact that his wife   a   white lady     had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her    so blanche is usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen    blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child    hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half black child   although it s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond     so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth   and hammond poisons blanche    hammond then finds mede   shoots him twice in the shoulder   and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water    yes   you read right   the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive    judging only by the plot     mandingo   is pure sexploitation    the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible   with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society    when   mandingo   was released in 1975   it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail   this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs    dramatically     mandingo   is weak and unfocused   and historically it s mostly confused    if one were to judge history by this film   it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality   not economics    not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working   except for a few house servants    the men spend most of the time sitting around   while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner    there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves   but   mandingo s   overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick   although there s plenty of violence    fights   vicious beatings   shootings   and the aforementioned human boiling sequence    thrown in for good measure      some tried to write off   mandingo   as a blaxploitation film   one of a number of quickly made   low budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies   but it s not that easy       mandingo   was studio financed by paramount pictures   and produced by dino de laurentiis   the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as   the bible     1966     the remake of   king kong     1976     and the ill fated   dune     1984      the director was richard fleischer   a veteran who was best known for several special effects laden action movies including   20   000 leagues under the sea     1954   and   fantastic voyage     1966     as well as such superior suspense films as   the narrow margin     1952      the script   based on the supermarket best seller by ken ostott   and the subsequent play by jack kirkland     was penned by norman wexler   who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on   serpico      james mason   perry king   and susan george were well known and respected actors   mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt     and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career    so why is   mandingo   so bad    a number of reasons   including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job    wexler s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive   it combines stereotyped slave talk     yessuh   massuh       stereotyped southern white trash talk     fer whut re you gittin  outta bed         and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk     if you see me hang   you gonna know you killed a black brother          fleischer s direction is clumsy   especially during the fight scenes   and all the actors give weak performances   especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable    nevertheless   credit should be given where credit is due    despite its exploitative nature     mandingo   was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery    until then   there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery    even classics such as   gone with the wind     1939   can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter       mandingo   reassessed the south   and showed that it wasn t all beautiful plantations   green fields   and pretty sunsets    but all this is constantly undermined by the film s negligible point of view    it claims to see things from the black perspective   but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners    with a little more maturity and different handling     mandingo   might have been an effective   worthwhile film    while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery   it never deals with them    the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile   but wexler s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing    there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner   but   mandingo   never does it    steven spielberg touched on that same topic in   schindler s list     1993     by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid    the difference between that film and   mandingo   is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair   unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma       mandingo   is satisfied to simply show some skin   and because of that   its   trashy potboiler   nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished    
1057	1	i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory    this was   of course   a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this    not only did i get to see an advance screening   i was able to see an advance screening of a   very good   movie    the very fast paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher   a fast talking   witty   comical taxi driver in new york city    gibson s performance is terrific   and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films    gibson again teams up with richard donner   as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick   and this time around   the combination works even better    the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique    try to imagine a toned downed version of travis bickle who   this time around   is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover ups    if you can imagine that   then you ve basically got jerry fletcher    in many ways   i was surprised by this movie    to begin with   i was surprised at how good it was    don t get me wrong   it s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring   but it was a very enjoyable movie    secondly   i was surprised at mel gibson s performance    he provided a fantastic performance    the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all out action flick   which after viewing   it was almost the opposite in a certain sense    gibson s character has an almost uncountable number of one liners   hilarious situations   and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film    for instance   jerry s apartment   and especially his security   is memorable    and last   i was surprised at how good the plot is    writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story   and when watching this film   you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher s far fetched   or so they seem at first   conspiracy theories are helgeland s own opinions    mel gibson isn t the only stand out in the film    julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton   the department of justice employee who can t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher   who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories    he also seems obsessed and in love with her    but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories   she shrugs him and his beliefs off   continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him    jerry   obviously determined to continually seek out the truth   continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory   which will be printed in his newsletter   same title as the movie      although he only has five subscribers   he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work   and publishes his next edition    very soon after he does so   he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr   jonas   patrick stewart      after barely escaping alive   jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust   alice sutton    the remainder of the film is almost always fast paced and full of action and suspense   with jerry s life being constantly put into jeopardy    and more along the way   the audience   and alice   learn more and more about jerry s life    many things are explained throughout this film   both to the characters and to the audience    for instance   the meaning of the book   the catcher in the rye   and its ties to assassins   the reason lone gunmen have three names   e   g    lee harvey oswald and james earl ray     and the real truth behind the grateful dead    make sure listen closely throughout the film   as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above    definitely   when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th   make sure you are standing in line to see it    i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film   especially if you are into an action thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations    and even if you aren t   you should still like this film    
446	0	the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer s other comic book adaptation   batman and robin    both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts   but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty headed character motivations    in panel sized morsels   implausible plots and   rambo    esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork   but on thirty foot silver screens   it s much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures    spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons   white   who is framed by a corporate baddie   played without irony by sheen     then set on fire and left for dead    though the movie skimps on the next few plot points   here s what i could determine   said assassin then becomes the leader of satan s army   under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown   leguizamo   grating as always      he is renamed   for reasons unbeknownst   spawn   and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon    but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child   he realizes that he can t be the evil superdemon he s expected to be   and he sets about avenging his untimely death    typical of summer blockbusters   spawn is an effects laden ninety minute rock video    while the visions of hell are laughably crude   think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man     spawn s prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold    but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion   spawn longs for his wife   but they don t have a single scene together before simmons  death       conflict   who will triumph is not anybody s guess     and believability   not that i expected it      so many questions are left unanswered   and i m sure they won t be addressed in the inevitable sequel    while last year s the crow   city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative   which was lazy and somewhat incoherent     it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power    spawn is an in your face   screaming banshee of a film   these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid   but they haven t the faintest idea how to make a movie

1871	1	have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally   at any given moment   in life    or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world   or outside of it    these thought provoking questions are the subject of   final destination     which is the most riveting horror drama since 1999 s   the sixth sense      stylishly filmed and tautly directed by   x files   alum james wong   the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters   in accurately written   teen speak     rather than overwrought   highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn t use     all the while developing into a darkly foreboding   severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less successful   but still suspenseful epilogue    at the start of the film   17 year old high school senior alex browning   devon sawa   is about to leave with his 40 student french class for a field trip to paris    progressively getting a case of preflight jitters   he spots several mysterious   coincidences

john denver died in a plane crash     alex grudgingly mutters to himself    once seated   alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff   and after causing a ruckus onboard   he   as well as six other students and a teacher   are thrown off    arguing in the airport lobby   alex s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight   killing all 300  passengers   including the rest of their classmates    as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode   the fellow survivors   whom he has saved   treat him in varying manners    carter   kerr smith     the hotshot jock   holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate    alex s best friend   tod   chad e   donella     wants to stand by him but can t because of his fearful parents    the teacher   mrs   lewton   kristen cloke     is frightened by him   believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster   as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker    only outsider clear rivers   ali larter     who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex s premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before   is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life    that is only the setup of   final destination     and the less said about what follows   the better    suffice to say   the film does   indeed   turn into a slasher film   albeit one that is more thoughtful than most   and replaces a knife wielding maniac for the never seen granddaddy killer of them all   the grim reaper itself    the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes   and   final destination   surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years    graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner   they manage to occasionally be so intense you don t know whether to shrink down in your seat   tap your feet in nervousness   or turn away    devon sawa   a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999 s underseen slasher comedy     idle hands     is even more of a charismatic presence here    the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival   which he comes to believe he wasn t meant to do   as well as the loss of the other passengers   is superbly and subtly acted on his part    one scene   in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful    ali larter   1999 s   varsity blues       in the other central role   is also effective   as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before   leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man  the exact opposite of her now deceased father    the other roles are not as fully written   and most remain rather one dimensional    the movie is mainly sawa s   however   and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles    tony todd   1992 s   candyman       as an arcane morgue attendant   pops up for a five minute cameo   but his appearance is rather supererogatory    and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye   while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy    ultimately   what is so good about   final destination   is that   within the confines of the slasher genre   writer director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner   and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten  two things that are rarely found in today s horror films    if anything   it s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again    
1197	1	there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie    action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences   while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full circle    for fans of both genres   however   realism is key    action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic   and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie s end    on this advice   director john frankenheimer   the island of dr    moreau   strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller   ronin    the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing   considering the fare that s fallen into the same category over the last few years    the script   written by j   d   zeik in his big screen debut   approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission   impossible two years ago    a certain number of people will be lost by this   but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times    frankenheimer masters the script with poise   and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck    his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here   and ronin becomes a better movie because of it    robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time    he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex spy sam   a man who s called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre   natascha mcelhone   recover a package    the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast   especially once the requisite double crossing begins   and its role is skillfully penned by zeik    at times   however   zeik s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission   impossible   de niro might easily become tom cruise   the package might become cruise s computer disk    fortunately   the focus here is almost entirely on the package   whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double cross and why it happened    the action content is impressive   and it lives up to the hints given in previews    the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness    ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish   but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots    the suspense tapers off considerably by the end   a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie s open    considering these factors it s good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well   and it s another good bet this month    since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months   it s definitely worth the visit

1477	1	rated   r for strong language   sexual dialogue   drug use   crude humor   violence and brief nudity    starring   ben affleck   matt damon   linda fiorentino   salma hayek   alan rickman   chris rock   kevin smith   jason mewes   jason lee   george carlin   alanis morissette    running time   130 minutes  being a huge fan of kevin smith   i was expecting a lot out of his newest project  dogma     it might just be kevin s best work to date    it s very funny with smart and foul mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ   it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn t    in 1994 a little  27   000 movie premiered at sundance    this little film was called  clerks  and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation    you really can t meet a person on this green earth who has not seen  clerks     it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming    in 1995 kevin made another movie  mallrats  that flopped horribly   thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick    it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997  chasing amy  came out and was kevin s biggest success to date    now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of  dogma     wow   what a cast    ok here is the plot in this movie   linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic    one day at her house metatron   the voice of god   appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels   matt damon and ben affleck   from getting back into heaven by ways of a church    ok now get this   she is told to find two prophets   one who talks a lot and one who doesn t   however she gets jay and silent bob instead   who give us great performances      now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky   chris rock   and helps guide her to find these angels    salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way    azrael   jason lee   who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win    bethany   linda fiorentino   has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith    what a movie   it is everything rolled into one   an offensive   offbeat   smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end   and ends up being a feel good movie    who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself    now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart    yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot   but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven   it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god    this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie    kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie    of course the best   and funniest   of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob    probably the best characters in movies that i like    the star studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin   jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while    the script was written by kevin smith with many f words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn t and makes us laugh at the same time as we think    chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well   with some classic lines    linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is    of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay   as well as silent bob      alan rickman   jason lee   salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles    being oscar winners for the classic  good will hunting  they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could    ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story    the movie s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it    however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members    dogma  stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to  clerks     while being funny at times   in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can t deny it     dogma  will offend people   especially deeply religious people   but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you    all kevin smith fans must see      
1976	1	   note   there are spoilers regarding the film s climax   the election   of course    we see matthew broderick   a man torn to a primal state   he s been unfaithful to his wife   lied to and manipulated his students   and by the same token they ve demeaned his masculinity   his self respect   his desperate attempt at changing the world    and yet   he equates the cause of his pain   his torment   with tracy flick   reese witherspoon      no matter how many students have come and gone   and disappointed him as an educator   she s the real threat    about to give in   and divulge that she s won by only a lone vote   broderick s mccalister turns in defeat   sees tracy s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says    no     the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men   no matter how obscure   have in their relationships   a traditional expectation of success   to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry    she can t go higher than him    he won t allow it    and what s amazing about   election   is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor    early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically   and then sexually   involved with a now departed teacher    it s like payne and taylor   his co screenwriter   have taken tracy   a girl desperate for friendship   loyalty   and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers   that they found sitting at the teachers  lunch table more fitting   to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist    and it s amazing the compassion that we have   it seems so real to us   and not merely because it s happened before   splashed all over the front pages   but   because of the all around   nice   persona of these people   we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters    it s with mandy barnett s   if you ll be the teacher   playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most   a final   viscous injection of bittersweet irony    sexuality   though   is not the only basis for payne s satire   or its success    it also makes a telling point about politics   friendship   and class boundaries    satire is required   or ought to be   anyway   to take itself seriously   or act so   while the audience does not    it s a fine line to straddle   but some films ignore it altogether     drop dead gorgeous   leaps infuriatingly to mind      payne and taylor hit the right chord   their characters are real people   neither is perfect   but rather both of the leads are flawed   misguided individuals who retain   somewhat   noble intentions at heart    we sympathize with them   but still   as a satire   their idiosyncratic behavior   and their wrongdoing   is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle   but also reflect and meditate   about    minus half a point   though   for payne admitting not to having seen   ferris bueller s day off      whatever    
468	0	running time approximately 1hr 40mins  reviewed by jack choo  rating    the movie starts with a rather se7en ish opening sequence   rather cool and sets the mood for things to come    the story propels the audience into a neo reality   somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red    existenz is actually the name of a new virtual reality game    supposedly   vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal drug in this neo reality               leigh   is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game experience in the form of existenz    players are required to have bio ports embedded in their spine   which plugs to a game pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience    during a secretive beta testing cum teaser meeting for this new game   an assassination attempt on       life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard         law             is more of a realists than anything else   afraid that he ll lose reality if he begin to play these games but       requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt    as they soon discover   they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected    existenz has all the cronenberg gore that is expected of him    even so   this film is no where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners    not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly    existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90 s version of videodrome   even so   it is a poor follow up    while in most of his famed films   his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot    in existenz   the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over indulgence than anything else    jennifer jason leigh and jude law   both commendable actors   looked aloof and miss directed throughout the entire film    the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b grade category    it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film   the opening sequence   though   probably formed a considerable portion of the budget      which is actually quite good    existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times    10 years ago   it would have been another classic for cronenberg    cronenberg fans however     those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film   should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you    
839	0	a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets    the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities    the result is merely an academic exercise   leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn t build on to show them as the poets they were    on paper   this shouldn t have been so terrible    it had a talented director in agnieszka holland     the secret garden       a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton   dangerous liaisons     and a capable cast    but the film was done in by its inept script   the unappealing way the film was directed   and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud    i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film   with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius   spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade    he   especially   looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be    but when the two of them were together   it looked like a mismatch    leonardo s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude   yet we know from rimbaud s poetry   that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring    the film opens in post revolutionary france in 1871   the 16 year old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems    he accepts verlaine s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home   and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville    once there   rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household   has an immediate conflict with verlaine s busty 18 year old wife mathilde   romane     and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family s money   even though he has nothing else in common with her    when verlaine states     poets can learn from one another     rimbaud replies in a haughty tone     only if they re bad poets      he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship    verlaine proves to be weak willed   beating his wife regularly   and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud    when mathilde s father kicks rimbaud out of the house   verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers    it s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets   which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce    in brussels   verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail    while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19    he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun runner   and after ten years there   comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37    the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying    the film ends on a whimper       with  verlaine talking with rimbaud s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses   which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published    this film was especially annoying because rimbaud s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film   as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry    i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film   but whatever it was   it just didn t work    it certainly didn t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so called father of modern poetry    
262	0	i have never been a   star trek   fan   and   to tell the truth   out of the five films in the series that i have seen   1   2   3   8   9     i have disliked all of them    i do   however   always go into one of these with an open mind   and the ninth film in the series     star trek   insurrection     is no exception    dropping almost completely the hard core sci fi element of the previous one in the series     first contact       insurrection     tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people   known as the ba ku   as well as the fountain of youth    at the start of the picture   the villagers go under attack by a second alien species   known as the son a   who want to push all of the ba ku out so that their own race will not die out    also attacking the ba ku is data   brent spiner     a robot from the star trek enterprise    after returning to jean luc picard   patrick stewart   and the gang on their space ship   no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force    so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba ku   where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants   a sultry   kind alien woman   donna murphy     who is over six hundred years old   but looks to only be in her thirties       star trek   insurrection     is a completely unoriginal and cheap looking installment in the series   and is a big step down from   1996 s   first contact     which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different    in     insurrection     however   it plays like a low rent episode of the television show   due to the small scale   generic storyline   and an emphasis on one liners rather than excitement    the film was filled with nearly non stop comedy   and worse yet   most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff    meanwhile   when there were action sequences   they were not at all interesting or inventive   relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very   very slowly    this plot device   which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays   is getting old fast    are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax    another element of     star trek     films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest   but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later    although donna murphy   who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here   is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103 minute running time   alfre woodard was far superior in     first contact      she should have returned for this one   but i don t blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie s disappointing and often lifeless screenplay   by michael piller       star trek   insurrection     is perhaps the weakest film in the   star trek     series   although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst     star trek v   the final frontier         insurrection     is the type of   safe   sequel that will bewilder non fans   since it is so low tech compared to most of today s blockbuster action films   although most of these are honestly not very good   either     and should disappoint the loyal trekkies   since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts    on second thought   they probably should have completely thrown the script out    that way   they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness

894	0	okay   bear with me y all   cause first off i have to get this off my chest    what the hell is up with that damn crab        whew   okay    cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end   as cute as the crab maybe    even i know that you need more footage than   that      and that wasn t the only thing getting on my nerves    the cutesy gimmicks   saccharine sweet score   soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar   as amanda   and sean patrick flannery   as tom   might have held some appeal during   oh   say the first 10 minutes of the movie    at first the movie moves along at a quick   interesting pace    it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street   whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just   doesn t   die    a ridiculous concept   yes   but at this point i m willing to accept it because i m willing to accept that this is how amanda s life is changed   how her powers are received    later on   the movie can t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom    and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying   they weren t just repetitive   they were out of place and unnecessary    the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed   sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development   amanda suddenly becoming a great chef   her falling in love with tom   etc       sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good    some places the plot just doesn t make sense   sometimes it s way too contrived   the crab bit   for example     and sometimes too corny   peaches emitting dry ice    can t beat that      all in all the plot seemed fragmented   unconnected    not romantic at all   and only funny in some places    so   okay   do the magic powers come from the crab    or the fairy godfather    she can   float   now too    and all of a sudden   instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches   she can put her emotions into her food    tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda s   witchcraft   in the end    would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac s video    what the hell is up with that damn crab    it is unfortunate   because i liked the basic premise of the movie   until it became too fantastical and tiresome    the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least   a   theme for a while   but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables    the humor was good in some places   nolan gets the funniest bits   including that incomprehensible   totally random thing with the dolls      gellar and flannery are qualified actors   and gellar has a particular charm   but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy   or even annette in the upcoming   cruel intentions     than this sorry excuse for a character    it s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is   or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible    the supporting character nolan was a highlight   though he reminded me a bit of kevin in   you ve got mail     see footnotes      and   as always   typical of a chick flick   romantic comedy   there s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background   cued up at all the right places    this sort of got on the nerves after a while   too       simply irresistible   is not hard to understand   light   funny in some places   and generally disappointing because it can t draw the line between romance and protracted sap   between humor and tired slapstick    and how could i refrain from making a pun                   simply irresistible   is all too easy to resist       first viewing   2 6 99       did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to   you ve got mail     or   the shop around the corner        business rivals fall in love    female counterpart s business is in danger of being shut down    female as mother  like figure guiding her    the annoying   hysterical ex girlfriends       i  really  like sarah michelle gellar s wardrobe    
678	0	bad   bad    bad    that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls    if that summary isn t enough for you   how about t a   t a   t a    still haven t got the point    other than director russ meyer s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore mentioned anatomical areas   there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie    that is the fact that it was co written by famed film critic roger ebert   who also was responsible for the screenplay    after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face    this movie stinks out loud    quite frankly   this movie deserves a    but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny    so i m giving it a    and maybe that is too generous    right from the opening credits   i knew that i had a class a bomb on my hands    not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting   but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform    i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening   it does get explained later   and as soon as the first scene is over   we cut to a completely unrelated scene    to be honest   as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was   i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film    with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film   it wouldn t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained    so what is this movie about    you ask    like it really matters    ok   here goes    this all girl band headed by kelly macnamara   dolly reed   and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry    once there   they do manage to find success   due as much to their hooters as anything else   it sure wasn t for their brutally bad singing voices     and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them    everything from big egos   to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral    there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure   but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing     from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here    other than the above mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have    the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts    mr   ebert has generously thrown in helpings of   hey man       dig   and my all time favorite      this is my happening   and it freaks me out      now i ask you   with lines like that how can you go wrong    ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue    maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter    i don t know   but all the big words in the world wouldn t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting    but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie    i ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey    in fact   there is one scene    the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes    during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries    add to the directing and writing the music in this movie    i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken   there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers    then we have the cast    first lets start david gurian who played harris   the manager of the band    this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera    sadly   his acting doesn t come close to making up for his looks    if you have been following along up to this point   this shouldn t surprise you    meyer s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets    dolly reed plays kelly   the leader of the band    and no surprise here   she was cast for her cup size   not her talents    and yes   she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents    sadly   her ass is almost as large as her chest    hey   it a sexist movie   so i m writing a sexist review    then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey   one of the other band members    this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie    meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all   but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all    sure russ   now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows    on the up side   she does have a fun lesbo scene    i sound like i m writing a review in a porn magazine    but hey   i ll admit it   the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked    and since that was a huge disappointment   i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey    the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it    unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too    and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d s    you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet    this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs    an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls    beware   this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense    proceed with extreme caution    
1169	1	roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton    this italian film star   best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther   has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust    but benigni s life is beautiful   la vita e bella   is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love   devotion and sacrifice    the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni s guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore    like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him   most notably the almost forgotten harry langdon   benigni s guido has a childlike innocence    he ignores the growing anti semitism of the fascist government    instead   guido ardently falls in love and persues dora   a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official    in benigni s tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate   yet slapstick   encounter    guido wins dora    they marry    fast forward about five years    guido   dora   and their 5 year old son   giosue     giorgio cantarini   are a happy family    guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore    but racial and anti semitic tensions are on the rise in italy   and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities    the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp    here   guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son   but to keep him from being exterminated    it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched    for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror   the pain   the unimaginable suffering of a schindler s list    true   many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over   and most were not sent to the death camps   but to work camps where they were used as slave labor    unlike steven spielberg   benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust    his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child    for guido   to save his son   transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game    giosue   must follow the rules without question to amass 1   000 points    the winner takes home a tank    therefore   guido tells him   he must remain hidden in the barracks    he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him    guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates    guido   lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners   instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive    throughout their imprisonment   guido s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm s way    ultimately   the allies rescue the camp    in a poignant scene   giosue   comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound    the boy goes wide eyed with wonderment and delight   thinking he has won the game    the price for his victory is most high    benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell   a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness    life is beautiful is a fantasy   a fable    it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust    those who object to it are missing its point    and that is simply where there is hope   where there is life and where there is love   the spark of humanity will never be extinguished    committed to lifelong learning through effective communication
