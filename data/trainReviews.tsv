712	0	after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors   mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball    fiercely unoriginal   director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him    there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind    the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars    the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13    interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001   a space odyssey    instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie   de palma stops right there   refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart    mission to mars takes it s first wobbly steps at a pre launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done    during these surface scans of the characters   we learn that jim mcconnell   sinise   has lost his wife    it s a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety    the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability    there is no contentiousness   no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time    maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff   but in that movie   the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects    it s the year 2020 and this is nasa s first manned excursion to the red planet    a crew   led by luke graham   cheadle     arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly   which they investigate with tragic results    graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth    in response   earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell   woody blake   robbins     wife terri fisher   nielsen   and phil ohlmyer   o connell      obstacles are put in the crew s way and and they matter of  factly go about solving them    i should say   mcconnell goes about solving them    time and again   mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind   which wouldn t be so bad if the rest of the crew didn t come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable       mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew s mission and life is in mortal danger    on a team of professionals   she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link    women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character s personality trait      by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred   mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush    there is an adage in film to   show   don t tell      mission to mars does both    repeatedly    characters obsessively explain the obvious   explain their actions as they are doing them   explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them    the film s conclusion is momumentally derivative   anti climatic and unsatisying    as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film    the best i could come up with is pre teen age boys   but in this media saturated era   this film s components would have been old hat even for them    i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good   modern day b movie    the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material    i felt no such earnestness    
1319	1	john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles    so effortlessly that people tend to forget he s there   much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors   anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors      example   the other day my mother asked me   the expert   of course   if there were any movies out worth seeing   never mind that our tastes couldn t be more divergent    i ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes   and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go    was a lot of fun   which it is     so i didn t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation    i muttered   with a little trepidation   that she might enjoy high fidelity    she responded with her usual query     whose in that one      this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see    if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light   a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing   and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people   usually of the jewish faith   fretting about in some upper east side palace    anyway   when i answered   john cusack     she replied with a rather stunned   who       as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to    now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies   most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin   but i suppose it s understandable that she would not recognize the name   after all   for most   names are tougher than faces    i showed her a picture of cusack s mug in the paper hoping for an   oh   him   yes he s quite good   instead i got a   no   i don t know him      at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger   yes   filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone     till i realized something   i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack s relatively bland visage   or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise   one syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car    cu sack   cu sack   no   not quite as cool    i m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as   the guy from   add in the cusack film of your choice        he s not a brand name   and his movies usually aren t big moneymakers   but in his own unassuming way he s kind of a genius    with his pleasant   common man looks   and charming semi articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90 s    from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon    despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it   the schlumpy every man     he s a constantly enjoyable screen persona   like albert brooks or woody allen    and he knows how to chose scripts   while the stephan baldwin s and val kilmer s seem to put them selves in everything   the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle   and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent     cusack generally picks rewarding projects   save for the unwatchable hot pursuit   a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller      high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears   the grifters   the hi lo country     and it s a hit    it was also co written by cusack   and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy   grosse point blank    it s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film   but as it progresses in its meandering fashion   the movie cast something of a spell over me    high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non committal rob   a vinyl record store owner   who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his   top 5 break ups list      this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller s day off    at first the talking directly into the camera schtick had me vaguely annoyed   mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit   but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack s witty delivery    he s the kind of guy we don t mind talking directly to us    gradually the film settles into a shampoo like tragi comic character study   of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is   yes it s all very existential      though that plot line is mostly enjoyable   the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters   all of whom   now this is really something   are terrific enough to warrant their own films    the best of which is jack black   of the very funny show tenacious d   a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis  hair       unfortunately that annoying smirk remains     an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy    he s the kind of guy i m sure we ve all met before   a blowhard who thinks he s always right and will do anything in his power   be it yell   argue   insult   to hoist his opinion onto others    but i like this guy   because of how black plays him    the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes   but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak   which might be a bit of a redundant description   seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic      he s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films       look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister      but fears and black never let that happen    the character   for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality    he s over the top   but in a way we can all probably relate to    catherine zeta jones   in her brief role   gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own   charm      tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age type   a character played entirely for cartoon yuks   but still manages to work its desired comic effect    the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy   the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle   mifune     who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent   replacing it with a stilted american phonation    i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role   but instead of being likeable   she comes across as rather robotic   and as such it s hard to see why cusack s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful   intelligent writer   natasha gregson wagner   potentially waiting in the wings    this reminded me of say anything   where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye   and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood   whose unbelievably more wooden then father   clint for those   special people   whose wheels turn a little slower      in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his   though i d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles   the result would be more effective    high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances    fears  direction is somewhat stilted   and the script is sometimes a little too   and this is a word i m beginning to hate to use but alas i must   quirky for its own good   i think i ll blame that on scott rosenberg   who judging from what he did with beautiful girls   con air   and things to do in denver while your dead   has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie      but cusack really does deserve an award   for being so damn       cusackian    i m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent    his character   rob   whose sort of like an older   more bitter lloyd from say anything   is funny and tragic without being pathetic   and that cusack can do all this   and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences   is something of an achievement    
1488	1	every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre   with dramas   it was citizen kane   with arthouse it was pulp fiction   and with comedy it was   well   that jim carrey guy   okay   so he s not a movie   but he did have a huge influence on the genre    not to mention an expensive one      sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big   sprawling motion picture event   as did forrest gump four years ago    with action films   it was aliens   whic was released to much hype seven years after it s equally innovative parent   alien   1979      directed and written by james cameron   t2   judgement day   the abyss   true lies     the authority on action films   it was a masterful encore to his sci fi thriller the terminator   1984      while the original alien film was a dark   enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew   james cameron took the big budget action film with aliens   which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing   although on a much larger scale    and boy   did he take that route    i d say at about 165 mph or so        the film opens 57 years after the original   with lt   ripley   weaver   being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel    if you ll recall   at the end of alien ripley   the only surviving member   cryogenically   hibernated   herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship    unfortunately   she thought she d only be out for a couple of weeks        once she s returned to earth   ripley is quickly interrogated by   the company     who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy    in truth   they believe her   as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an   alien advisor      it seems that the colony planet was a once breeding ground for the nasty aliens   and now all communication with the planet has been lost        it doesn t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next   ripley agrees   and before you can say   big mistake     she and the half dozen marines   plus the slimy corporate guy   reiser     who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve   are off to the colony    when they arrive   they find the planet in ruins    only one survivor is found   a little girl   newt   who confirms that   yes   the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system    and soon enough   the marines come under attack from the aliens        what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci fi movie   the action scenes    cameron directs them so skillfully   and so suspensefully   that you re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around    which features   in my opinion   the best fight scene ever recorded on film   as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death    many people will tell you that this film   while being a great action film   has no real drama and is all cliches    well   they would be wrong   my friends    if this film had no   drama     then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards    that s right   best actress    you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f x has got to be good    in short   aliens combines all the right elements   great action and f x   drama   a good plot   good dialogue   and great villains   into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time    then again   maybe not    movies rise and fall from glory and   sad to say   aliens was wrestled from it s throne of best action movie by another cameron film   t2   judgement day   in 1991    so who will be the next king    well   let s wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film the highest budgeted film of all time titanic to make that decision    i can t wait    
76	0	for better or worse   the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated   oversexed   underwritten thrillers    apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn t change a thing   since body of evidence wasn t written by him   but has a puzzling eszterhas ish presence all over it    in other words   it s a   really dirty and b   really   really stupid    madonna   first warning sign   stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job   she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi naked   presumably for the edification of the shrimp    she s been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover    already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect    the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she s under thirty   or at least looks it     and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men    what s worse is that the movie confirms all the above   and wallows in them as well    madonna s character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition       and yes   there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy    this movie leave no scummy stone unturned      anyway   willem dafoe   very good but completely wasted   also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna s sexuality    how do we know this    because his character is set up with the token wife and kids    how obvious is it that he s gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up    and get kicked out of the house    and get welcomed back anyway    don t skip to the end yet   we re just getting warmed up    dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie    most of it is about as erotic as open heart surgery   since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax   always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don t know the first thing about   really   kinky sex   and smashed light bulbs    don t ask    another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story   it s insanely dull    what s worse is that body of evidence is dull   everywhere     not just in the sex scenes    the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes    the thriller business itself is ridiculous    it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs   and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor    and the ending    another homage to eszterhas   maybe       is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact   frame   where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in    the director is uli edel   all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f   everyone has to eat   i guess   but this isn t a meal ticket   it s leftovers    
69	0	   first rule of fight club is   don t talk about fight club      this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film   because quite frankly   it s not even worth mentioning    director david fincher   seven   has completely gone over the edge    with crude humor   an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture   i m surprised i didn t walk out    this just goes to show that hype kills    it s very rare that a film so hyped up as   fight club   turns out to be noteworthy   and this is no exception    the story goes like this    edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions   until he meets marla   helena bonham carter      norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle   when he spots her at a session that he also attended    apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like   literally living in pain    why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me   but things do get worse    norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling   and it s on a plane that he meets tyler durden   brad pitt      the two men develop a bond   and go out to a bar   and by golly after they get drunk   the two pitiful characters fight    how do they come up with this stuff    anyway   their fighting catches other pathetic loser s attention   and a club is formed    out of all this mess   there manages to lie a message    fincher shows us that society is like robots    we work in our jobs doing things step by step   and want out    our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are   and we blame it on others    call me crazy   but this is common knowledge    i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is   which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably    even with two good actors   and a solid actress   they only manage to weaken the story    i couldn t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp    it just shows how desperate the script is for attention    i guess brad pitt was right for this role   because i felt like beating him up myself    his bothersome and depressing character   made me disgusted at his 20 million fee    it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more    helena bonham carter however really had no purpose    she just popped up on screen   mumbled some lines   smoked and left    this continues for what seems like 6 hours    the film drags on and my headache gets bigger   while   fight club   nears what i think might be the end    unfortunately by then   the film hits rock bottom    though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes   it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace    on a side note   the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film   that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer    fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson    concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment   won t do any good if everything else is in need of support    also   i m afraid that immature men might respond to the film s violence    the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult    when the film ends   i m just glad to get home and take some advil    you ll either enjoy what the film has to offer   or agree with ed norton when he says   this is so f       ing stupid

1816	1	when i was asked to see this movie with a friend   my initial reaction was   not hugh grant      i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh   but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker   i just could not picture him in any romantic lead    what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh   but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script    this writer richard curtis   whose exceptional first work   four weddings and funeral  shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy   with splashes of drama thrown in between    hugh and his hair   is almost identical to the character that made him famous in   four weddings     he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck    unfortunately   he is type cast in this role   but fortunately it works well for him in this movie    if only he would dither a little less    julia knows this role well    the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love    there are moments in this movie   that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness    how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful   but to have no one to share it with    the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels    how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment    how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive   and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice    
1542	1	i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate   cuba s oscar nominee for best foreign film   directed by tomas gutierrez alea   who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo     memories of underdevelopment      i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late  70s   it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition    i knew then that memorias was probably a state sanctioned political missive   and now expect strawberry will follow suit    fellow internetters   primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba   soc   culture   cuba     have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs    i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line  it probably looks like political criticism   but it ain t so    having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro s repressiveness   i can t conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution   and i can t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement    as kids say these days   duh     the revolution s current state needs no criticism   its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident    the proper questions to put relate to castro s legitimacy    i bet the film takes castro s power for granted   and that this or any other movie   produced under cuba s state control   cannot question his right to run cuba s political show   ongoing now for more than 36 years      that s why i just can t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime    let s see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up    i saw the film  twice    i was right   castro remained intact    strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young   dialectic materialist     as he describes himself   and a homosexual photographer   diego   in 1979 cuba    the young man   david   is the son of peasants   a symbol of the revolution s reason for being    grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education   he studies political science instead of literature   his avocation   because he perceives it is his duty    therein lies a likely unintended irony   since cuba has no need for political theoreticians    cuba s government is castro    diego s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life    he enjoys the finer things  tea   opera   art    he does not do   voluntary work   for the revolution    his small apartment is a sensual oasis    the moniker   bourgeois   figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie    however   he is a   revolucionario   in his own way    the supporting roles are filled by   an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche   david s roommate   who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme   david s ex girlfriend   who dumped him for another guy   yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband   german   a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit   and who strikes a faustian pact with the government    gutierrez alea and co director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too    heck   towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor    he really loves the revolution   as supposedly does everybody else in cuba   and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws    real criticism is missing though    this movie is political window dressing    luis aguilar leon s op    ed    piece on fresa in the miami herald   10 march 1995   at 21a   did not color my judgment   it presaged my intuition    aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film s political angle best   like many artistic manifestations in cuba   strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment    as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes   the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept   the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point   while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point      although terrible propaganda   this is otherwise a fine film    
1153	1	near the end of 1996   analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king    the following year   1997   saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom   twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia    at best   that s all it was    a sleeper hit   designed to surprise but not shake the industry    in 1998   however   things have been decidedly different    there have been a number of pushes on disney s death grip on the market   and fifty one weeks into  98   a new champion has emerged    dreamworks  the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed    the other two contenders   warner brothers  quest for camelot and disney s own annual entry   mulan   lacked inspiration and drive respectively    although camelot was borderline abysmal   and can t really be considered a shot at the title   mulan had the makings of winner    unfortunately   it was saturated with traditional   disney cute animation   and lost points against the rapidly changing face of the competition    in making the prince of egypt   dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product    the animation is flawless   and   aside from a bug s life   is the best looking movie to date    the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects   and the 2d 3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with    the key to success   however   was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot    namely   some of the most important action sequences   like the parting of the red sea   were done almost entirely in 3d    dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ve got the stuff of success   and that they re capable of challenging disney    the story is also well written   and the characters voiced with talent    for the most part   the plot follows its source material    the book of exodus    although only in the most general sense    the writers took a few creative liberties   and most do not damage the story in any way    in fact   the shakespearean relationship between moses   val kilmer   and the pharaoh rameses   ralph fiennes   makes the story more interesting if anything    moses   a hebrew   is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile   he floats into the pharaoh seti   patrick stewart    s palace and is taken in by the royal family    moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert   where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves    by this time   rameses is now pharaoh   and the two brothers   now on opposite sides of the line   face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention    the cast of voices is most impressive   and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock   jeff goldblum   danny glover   and steve martin    the script does not have a lot of one liners in it   and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams   but overall the story is exciting and interesting    it s decidedly for an older crowd   and the tykes who haven t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost    but for those who make the bid   the prince of egypt can be a great watch    
1904	1	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    james toback s return to directing after a eight year layoff   two girls and a guy   is a film which is comprised   more or less   of just that   one guy   blake   robert downey jr       two girls   carla   heather graham   and lou   natasha gregson wagner     one primary setting   blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment     and a great deal of dialogue    embracing a near real time approach   this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr   toback for his bantering characters    fortunately   the film s cast is up to the challenge   and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters   while admittedly variable   are occasionally wickedly amusing    the film s setup is fairly generic in nature   and opens rather unpromisingly    we meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou   both waiting outside a soho loft    as they engage in idle chatter   it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport   and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two timed by the same guy    more indignant with him than catty with each other   the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation    it s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride    played with magnificent bombast by mr   downey jr     blake is a cad   all right   but a captivatingly dynamic   blusterous   and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights    it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat   and perhaps the film s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return   allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others   but by his own innate behaviour    whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi   or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds   carla   lou   and his unseen sickly mother     it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful    though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show    a typical afternoon in the life of blake   if you will    carla   and then lou   reveal themselves   and the sparks begin to fly       one of the great touches in the film is how blake   when startled by carla s unannounced appearance   begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag      double teamed by the understandably aggrieved women   who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful    they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy     an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declarations against their verbal jabs    surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters   two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off limits for this film    however   it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length   and it s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel    the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever   the film s tempo loses its liveliness   the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion   and several sequences fall flat    subtle and not quite subtle allusions are made   a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall     and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale    one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla    two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter   long running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene    contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film   mr   toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc 17 rating in favour of an r    and while admittedly titillating   the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious    if anything   two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr   downey jr     whose versatility is put to the test in this film    he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled   from self assured to disconcerted   yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered    it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him   mr   toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr   downey jr   was arrested on drug charges   and it s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character    in a monologue to his mirrored reflection   blake s self chiding to   get  his  shit together   is disquieting in its resonance    while mr   downey jr    s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film   both actresses are solid in more broadly observed roles    ms   graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actresses   involving herself in three successive risky projects    two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank   while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman    she s quite appealing here   playing a character at once both dainty and sultry    meanwhile   ms   gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying   or   like me   endearing    she tones it down substantially as the film progresses   but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox    the film was reportedly shot in eleven days   filmed mostly in sequence   and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout    two girls and a guy has an agile   spontaneous sort of feel   and one senses that mr   toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors    while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact   it doesn t feel constricted   the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background   and mr   toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner    two girls and a guy falls short of its potential   but thanks to some stellar work by mr   downey jr     it s still often an enjoyable   bitingly funny romp   particularly as we watch the surprisingly resilient blake

93	0	capsule   the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies   dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension    alien 3   the   3   should be in superscript   is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen    it continues the story of ripley   the space trucker turned impromptu survivalist   but seems remarkably uninterested in her    in fact   the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all   it s so elegaic and limp    a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere   but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning    at the end of the last film   aliens     ripley and two survivors were on their way home    unfortunately   an alien pod had been deposited in their ship   and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod    the pod crashes on firorina 161   a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent    ripley lives through the crash   the others do not    the prison is a grim place   even as prisons go    it s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks   which provides no end of techno gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against    lice are endemic   and so ripley s head is shaved   another surreal touch      at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive   but it doesn t stay that way    one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches   and soon a newly gestated alien is running amuck    worse   it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated    what s weird is how little tension this generates   except near the end   when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable   loud music   shaky camerawork   etc   sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role   and she does well with it   but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack    the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do   the doctor   charles dance   and another   rather religious inmate   charles s   dutton   very good     hiave presence   but they re not asked to do anything with it    in light of the impending sequel   which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie   i will not talk about the ending    except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie    it s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn t have driven the rest of it    
1669	1	the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes   and the greedy trade federation has used it s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo    we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo s ruler   the young queen amidala   natalie portman   to sign a treaty giving the federation control    however   the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui gon jinn   liam neeson   and obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade    no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi   and the first battle begins    it seems that for me and thousands of people like me   the love for george lucas s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time    we re the fans   not the freaks    we won t go dressing up like darth vader   although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool     and we won t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations   not all the time   anyway     but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest   we re throwing down    all right   stop looking at me like that    we have been faithfully and patiently waiting    waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll    you see   the trilogy is not just a set of movies   but a religion of sorts to we   the faithful disciples   and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah    unfortunately   it is not our savior    for weeks beforehand   i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good   stupendously good   miraculously good    anything less and it ll be the biggest disappointment of the century    i didn t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true   really i didn t   but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking    character development is virtually nonexistent    with the possible exception of qui gon   most of the film s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions    none seem very affected by their experiences   and few even show any passion at all    contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks   a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo   in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala    jar jar s life is saved by qui gon early in the film   and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh   or supposedly so      his speech mannerisms are so   cute ified   that i couldn t understand a third of what he was saying   and the slapstick he performed was just distracting    his head gets caught in an electronic field   his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast   he describes being in trouble as   deep doo doo     and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport    therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors    in star wars   we had obi wan telling us mos eisley was a   wretched hive of scum and villainy      in the phantom menace   we get doo doo    the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story   a long time ago in a galaxy far   far away            this film   on the other hand   constantly reminds me that it s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience    perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition   it s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses     and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500 like play by play    i liked the pod race   it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension   but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters    the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction    this aspect   coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me    i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer   but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all    didn t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again    didn t the action figures still sell like hotcakes    of course they did   and it s only poor judgment that allows the most eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults    one aspect that will appeal broadly   however   is the use of special effects    the people at lucas s industrial light and magic   the world s premiere effects house   outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer generated images and real life footage    some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed   especially the shots of a land battle between the federation s robot army and jar jar s countrymen    the space battles are also impressive   although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer    this   however   is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today    john williams is back   of course   providing a score for the film as only he can    his music is pervasive throughout   as rousing and as dramatic as ever   always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately    since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine episode story   star wars   the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four   five and six   respectively     the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already   in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar    as a result   attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin    it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi wan   for example   but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover   it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films    one of the new characters is darth maul   hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film s release    in spite of the hype   darth maul is a character which almost didn t have to be in the film   his role is so insignificant    he has maybe three spoken lines   believe it or not   a second actor voices the character   and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean    with that working against him   he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment    lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe   something which has been prominent throughout    however   he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible   offering an easy out for story writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real life connection    oddly   while trying to capitalize on spirituality   lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force loving parasites in your body s cells    this only serves to de mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection    don t let me mislead you too far    the phantom menace   by most standards   is a good film    it contains a lot of visual treats   sets the stage for an epic story   gives us a bit of excitement here and there   and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends    it s just that when held up to it s predecessors   and to not do so would be unrealistic     this film simply pales    
1348	1	ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon   the book of the dead    bruce campbell stars as ash   who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods   and his friends who have become demons   including his own girlfriend      the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film s tiny budget   constant location changes   and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years    followed by two sequels   evil dead ii   1987   and army of darkness   1993      the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it s original aspect ratio of 1   33   1    the disc contains two versions of the film s audio   a stereo 2   0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5   1    included are two separate running commentary tracks   the first features writer director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film s star   bruce campbell    campbell s commentary is informative and extremely witty   as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film    such informative tidbits include   the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead   and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it s title   and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead   everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard    also   there s a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they ve found that s explaining about the demonic forces in the woods    for that scene   it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana   so being the wacky kids that they were at the time   they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene    almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor s had never smoked before   and as a result they became   confused   and were unable to perform the scene    i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi rob tapert audio track    the two people you d think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all    don t get me wrong here   when they do speak it s entertaining to hear   but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time    sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask   have anything to say sam      to me   that s not a good sign    also   it seems like sam raimi doesn t remember much about the film and it s production        well   compared to rob and bruce anyway    also included on the disc is a photo gallery   which includes pictures from the film s   gala   premiere   and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film    this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques    overall   the evil dead is a good low budget horror film   superior to many films in it s genre    and the collector s edition dvd release is well worth your time if you re either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process    all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining

684	0	often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into   the call of the oboe   o toque do oboe   is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray    many elements of the film are solid   and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know   but they simply don t convert into a solid work    although a setting is never established   it becomes apparent    the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day    the community is a dull one   where every day is a downhill slide from the last    over time   the people have taken to themselves    the town cinema is closed   no tourist has passed through in years   and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger    so what happens when a   tourist     paolo betti   does arrive one day    he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock    it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby    when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance   the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years    it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers   and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film   thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages    the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner   leticia vota   who also happens to be engaged to the town s police inspector   a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance s involvement with this musician    the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray    it features a character who literally rises from his grave   a woman who has a phone conversation with god   and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character   to an almost humorous drunk    technically   this film is a nightmare    the music score is poorly edited into the film   so it is often choppy   rough   and abrupt    the lighting is poor at best   which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes   and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words   and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases    this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue   but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words    in addition   the pace of the film seems uneven    it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one s patience    the film then moves into a faster pace   that again slows towards the end   as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark    there was   however   potential for this film    it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music   and the re unification of people    these are all topics that could easily fill a movie    perhaps   if there were no freak show   and the technical aspects were to improve   there might just be a thing of beauty at the end    most importantly   though   the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren t such a bore    until then   there seems to be little more hope for this piece   than that boy has by simply crying out   mommy   while he wanders astray in a park    
918	0	ah   and 1999 was going along so well   too       she s all that   has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i ve seen so far this year    and quite frankly   i doubt i ll see anything equally bad       at least   i   hope   i don t see anything equally bad         she s all that   tells the story of the most popular guy in school   played by freddie prinze jr     who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school   rachel leigh cook   into the most popular    that   right there   is problem  1    how many times have we seen this storyline    as cook comments near the end of the film     it s kind of like   pretty woman     except without the prostitution      of course   had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material   the well worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward    as it is   though     she s all that   relies   completely   on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead    there s not one original or interesting character in the film   either   and if that wasn t bad enough   there s not one good performance featured    the star of the movie   rachel leigh cook   is simply horrible    i usually don t like to get so personal   but in this case   i think it needs to be said    cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was    i was never convinced that she was a   nerd     and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary    the movie seems to be saying it s better to be popular than to be who you are    as for freddie prinze jr     an actor i ordinarily enjoy   he too is quite bad here    he coasts through the film on so called charm   and never establishes a real character    kieren culkin is here   too   as the brother of cook    and for some indiscernable reason   he s got hearing aids    no explanation is given and they re never brought up    were we supposed to feel   sorry   for him just because he wore hearing aids    i don t think so    that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i ve seen in a movie in a long time       she s all that   sucks    that s what it boils down to    it s not entertaining   and it s not even a good time passer    the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair removal system informercial    and what s worse   it sends out a bad message to teens    it appears to be telling them     hey   it doesn t matter if you re happy the way you are    that s unimportant    if you want to   truly   be happy   dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble headed moron      ugh

143	0	writers   dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh   based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer    starring   jamie lee curtis   william baldwin   donald sutherland   joanna pacula   sherman augustus   marshall bell   cliff curtis   julio oscar mechoso  i suppose i m not extremely surprised that   virus   comes to us from a deciple of james cameron   john bruno     and if i strain real hard   i could even say that it s an obvious given   particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr   cameron s early works    in fact     virus   is yet another in the long line of action horror paranoia thrillers from the   aliens   vein   a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally threatening entity is out to get them   a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies   and maybe even to the first pictures   albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future    no such thing will happen to bruno   whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi landmark feature   while bruno may have studied under cameron s wing for years and years   i m beginning to wonder at what capacity   and what exactly did he learn from him    in fact     virus   should at least be mediocre   the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron   a director who   if anything   just knows how to make a movie   and then make a film like   virus   is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z grade schlockfest of a film   albeit a z grade schlockfest with a respectable budget    the film seems to not only borrow it s plot from last year s similarly fated   deep rising     but also from a clunkish b movie from the  80s called   leviathan     an underwater thriller starring peter weller   richard crenna   hector elizando   and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part   alien     part john carpenter s twisted remake of   the thing         virus     again   has a similar   uh   selling point   a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water    they get on    they break up into pairs and investigate    and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy   has taken over all the machines on board   have meshed the machines with parts from corpses   and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary   ha ha      not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving   not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond ian opening   the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir     destroying any of the suspense in what could happen   but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters    of its motley crew   it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper   a masculine potential romantic interest   a drunken captain   a black technician   a tatooed aborigine   a manic russian survivor   and a couple other candidates for alien food   none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin   plain piece of writing paper    and it s not the traditional argument for films like these   where you may in fact want them all to be eaten   even   aliens   played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers   but this was more of a plus side for the film as a whole than the opposite     instead   as another cliche goes   you just don t give a damn    i almost don t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub par to horrific   the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is   and she is   just not really here   and the latter being   and it pains me to say this as he s a particular favorite of mine   donald sutherland   who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance of which he should be ashamed    like anthony hopkins for   legends of the fall     the line   scrooooooo  em   has been thus embroidered upon my membrance      or peter o toole in   caligula      great actor   horrific performance    it happens every now and then   and it only helps sutherland s career that no one   except for an elite few   even bothered to see this film    though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years   waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can   read   early january   when everyone s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar nominees     it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film   it s laden with complex machinery   boasts respectable production design   and it may even feature believable special effects       if   of course   i   or anyone else   could see them       virus   mostly takes place on a large   abandoned cruiser   and mostly at night until the dawn   and mostly without the use of lights   not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey   but more so because   as the hollywood cliche seems to go     if it s dark enough   then the special effects will be more believable      and if you don t believe me   go back and rent   godzilla     and tell me if there s even one shot where we see godzilla either a   in his entirety in one wide shot   or b   n the light so that we can at least see him   well   you don t really have to sit through it again   just take my word for it      but all of this doesn t matter since   virus   is basically just one loud   cluttered mess of a movie    the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i ve ever seen   my   um   favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship   during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves   rain   and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook up   then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned   well   i must say   thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn t figure it out when i saw it      imagine the first attack of the aliens in   aliens     shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity   and that s basically the whole of   virus     one horribly directed action scene after the other   capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members    and my god   it s a long damn sit    with no interesting characters   no dramatic urgency   no tension   not one good moment of action   and no mesmerizing visuals   it s a wonder that it even got made    we already know that big movie studios  mentality is shallow at best   and movies like   out of sight   and   saving private ryan   give you more faith in them   but movies like   virus   manage to drain a little more out of the pool    i almost wish that instead of making this movie   john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light    they read the script   they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack   and he is     and they still went ahead with the project   only to have bruno and company shit back in their face    even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie   i d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr   bruno for making a movie that could be this bad    in fact   shouts of   egad   man   what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway      are not only justifiable   but encouraged    
1981	1	let s say you live at the end of an airport runway    large jetliners continuously pass over your house   rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace    let s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances   and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home    now let s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway   and offers you more than it s worth    wouldn t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed    of course you would    but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise   and the house your castle    that s what they are to darryl kerrigan   michael caton     and although he s happy that a multi national corporation would like to buy his home   sorry   it s not for sale    unfortunately   the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government   which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice    not about to take this lying down   darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto   tiriel mora   and makes a determined   albeit pathetic   attempt to fight back    the castle   an australian comedy by rob sitch   is perhaps one of the simplest movies i ve seen in recent memory   yet also one of the funniest    in fact   it is this film s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful    the good guys and the bad guys are clear   the humor is straightforward   and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets    it s the perfect setup for a relaxing   hilarious good time   and as much as i hate to admit it   i liked the fact that i didn t have to think all that much while watching this film    i just sat back and enjoyed myself    the situation is one we ve seen before   regular joe fights back against the government   or big business   or whatever    what makes this film different is its characters    darryl thinks he s got the best life in the world   he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind   he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal   anne tenny     and he swells with pride when his son dale   stephen curry   digs a hole in the yard    steve kerrigan   anthony simcoe   constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for   investments   like jousting sticks and overhead projectors   while wayne kerrigan is in jail   as a result of dennis denuto s incompetent courtroom maneuvers    the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren t so stupid that they get annoying    they re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing    we look upon them with a little bit of pity   but a whole lot of affection    screenwriters sitch   santo cilauro   tom gleisner   and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate   further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans    sympathy for their situation   the laughter they bring us   and the family s wonderful characterization   simple as it may be   leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them    i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans   but trust me   it works    i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs    don t get me wrong   slapstick   when executed well   can be genius    it s just that too often   a film will resort to it s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience   not always successfully    instead   the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world    when they are by themselves   the are funny   and when they are with normal people   they are hilarious    one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though    the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film s running time    luckily   it s a funny little detour that   while slightly distracting from the film s main drive   is still quite enjoyable    with all the levity abound in the castle   the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept   that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property   an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes    i m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life   but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution   of australia   and certainly sounds impressive at any rate    and   for that matter   it s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this    
932	0	 soldier  is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn t have jean claude van damme in it    i could liken it to the sci fi cheese that was the hollywood product of choice back in the early 80s   but that would be too much of a compliment    if there is a movie theater in hell   this film is playing there 24 hours a day    the story   such that there is   revolves around todd   kurt russell     an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not too distant ultra conservative future   is there any other kind      after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him   todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy    who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed   but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn t matter   because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys    after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash    yes folks   there s more    we see todd as a buff   scarred adult   now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat    there s a new wrinkle   though    todd and his brethren are declared obsolete   and a new batch of soldiers takes their place    after losing a sanctioned battle with  dragon  s jason scott lee   the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice cube tray   well   that s what is looked like   on a remote garbage planet    if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet   and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them   you re way ahead of the game    the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute    it s surprising that  soldier  is the brain child of  blade runner  co writer david webb peoples    unlike that mind twisting classic   this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double spaced pages    add into the mix the  mortal kombat  s paul anderson inept direction   and it s easy to see how  soldier  turned out so bad    and the special effects    remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars    gary busey is in this movie     nuff said     soldier  is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults    that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all    now if you ll excuse me   i have to go weep for the future

1571	1	after a rather disappointing   mary railly     stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise    this is one of the best surprises of this season    a sweet   small budget comedy with a big heart    in fact it s not even a comedy    it s a drama or even more precise    a clever satire on human relationships and needs    based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby     high fidelity   is a wry and likable story about a man s quest for fulfillment and happiness    rob gordon was a dj    it seems that he could make everything spin    except his own life    now he owns championship vinyl   a little musical store   somewhere in new york    when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend   a gorgeous blond attorney   life suddenly looses every purpose    decimated   humiliated and on the verge of a mental   and emotional   breakdown   he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been    about what s right and what s important    he starts   categorizing   life   dividing it into   top 5 lists      and the most important is the   top 5 list   over the most painful breakups of his life   starting with 5th grade   when he found his young girlfriend with another boy    though you might think that people change   grow more mature with age   it just doesn t seem that way and all rob s relationships were different versions of that first    where did he go wrong    was it he that screwed up    or maybe life just stinks    while he is lost in his own self pity   he must think of the   top 5 list   over his needs for the future   find the right elements and mix his life together    with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity   music and with incredibly direct narration   it addresses the average audience member   in other words    people like you and me    although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter        and frears   the director   the acting is equally important as the written word    and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned    he is simply superb    it is as much his movie as it is frears     the film would not be the same without him    cusack    whose character is sadder   wiser and 35    brings intelligence and warmth to post  mod irony    most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera    not an easy task    but cusack pulls it off    his interpretation feels so emotionally right   so incredibly realistic and precise that frears  message simply can t be ignored or overseen    the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job    both        and jack black are fabulous    even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts   not just looks beautiful    however   the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob s co worker and friend dick    this is such an impressive achievement that it s almost worth a oscar nomination    he is simply a joy to behold    otherwise   everyone are in their place   and at the right time    all part of frears  colorful blend    pretty much like edward norton s   keeping the faith     this film doesn t follow any formula or belong to any genre    it s dramatic   tragic   sarcastic   comic and even cynical   but never bitter or angry    it s a little bit of everything   pretty much like life itself    nothing seems unreal or staged    it reflects reality as a mirror    as you watch it   you go through the same emotional problems as the main character    you feel and think and reflect    this effect has become a rarity nowadays    although it s primarily about the perils of love     high fidelity   is secondarily about pop music    rob owns championship vinyl and his employees   timid dick   todd louiso   and overbearing barry   jack black     are fellow music snobs    music is the language in their lives   the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives    and so does the movie    it is as much a musical film as anything else   as rob s journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments    in the end   you have gained something while watching it    it s not the film of the century or even of the year    it s not an special effects extravaganza    it doesn t require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed    it s a small movie about the big things    and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy   you feel as if you have experienced something of significance   and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time    
1234	1	   last night   could have an   aka   tagged on the end of it that says     it s the end of the world   and we feel fine         last night   is about just that    the last night of planet earth s existence    the world is going to end at precisely midnight   january 1st   2000    how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained    nor is the event itself    throughout the entire movie   no explanation is given as to why this is happening    in doing this   mckellar   who also wrote and directed the film   seems to be trying to transcend the genre    he s attempted to make a film about people   and how each of them deals with their last night of life    the film contains no science fiction elements   which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters    mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material    the film is set in toronto   and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence    there s mckellar   who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs   but keeps getting interrupted by a woman   sandra oh   in search of her husband    her husband   played by david cronenberg   is spending the day working at the gas company   informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end    finally   there s mckellar s friend   played by callum keith rennie   a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of    mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i ve seen in a film in months    these people all felt real to me   especially the character played by sandra oh    we can see her desperation   her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours    rennie is good   too   as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies    he exudes such charm and likeablity   it s not surprising that we re rooting for him to get what he wants    but for me   the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar    i knew that he was a talented director   but i had no idea he could act as well    his insistence to be alone   much to the dismay of his parents   is something that most people would find difficult to understand   but as played by mckellar   we can understand his reasons    he doesn t buy into the whole notion that just because everyone s going to die   he should immediately find some companionship    he realizes the relationship would be forced   and they would only be together for the sake of being together    mckellar gives a brilliant performance   and i hope he alternates between directing and acting    my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending    i really wanted to know   and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times    i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn t want the material to rule the film   and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious    however   in not telling the audience what the cause of earth s destruction is   he s left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film    another problem is we never see anybody panicking    i would imagine if the world was ending   and there was nothing to be done about it   a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds    instead   we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it s new year s eve    i just didn t buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate    no one had the urge to   rage against the dying of the light      despite these small problems     last night   is one of the best movies of the year    as opposed to the moronic   armageddon       last night   treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty    and bruce willis never shows up to save the day    
1135	1	it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters    his new film   the thin red line   is a strange   beautiful   enigmatic mess of a movie    the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast    it is filled with above the title stars    the cast   for the most part   gives great performances    john travolta   whose role is nothing more than a cameo   seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve    george clooney   whose role became a cameo in editing   gives a strange performance    one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character s narration    the rest of the cast   especially nick nolte and elias koteas   are unambiguously fantastic    these actors   and they are   with two exceptions   men   were lured by the name of malick    terrence malick is a cinematic legend    he has often been called   the j   d   salinger of cinema      his two previous films   badlands and days of heaven   are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures    after he made them   he disappeared for 20 years    this film marks his return    what he s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment    the narration which fills the film   and perplexes many   not only lets us hear the narrators   the characters themselves   pontificate   but also lets us hear such of the moment thoughts as   i m scared      the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted    the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill    a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult   because the story is fractured    many stories are here   from the clash between the lieutenant   elias koteas   and the savage colonel   a voracious nick nolte   to the private   ben chaplin   who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going    the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault    it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box   shook the box   and poured the results onto a table    this basically creates a mess   but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed    i m not declaring that the film has no structure    while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot   malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat    the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking    the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice    this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way   that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video    ultimately   malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them    the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature    while some have said that the anti war message and pro nature tubthumping was juvenile   it was done with so much complexity and thought   that it cannot ever honestly be called childish    after seeing the thin red line   i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again

805	0	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    it s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor s first feature film   dream with the fishes   when the plodding   tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup    any hopeful expectations   however   are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film s latter half    the film s central characters are terry   david arquette     a depressed   lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident   and nick   brad hunt     a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill    nick lives in the apartment building across from terry   who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz   kathryn erbe   with his trusty set of binoculars   but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge   unconvincingly vowing suicide    nick casually asks for terry s wristwatch   and eventually cons terry into a trade   the watch for a bottle of pills    of course   terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects   and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch    learning of nick s condition   he only has a handful of weeks left     terry s compassion kicks in   and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement   terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick s lifelong fantasies   and nick will fulfill terry s death wish by killing him    this is a promising premise   and mr   taylor s film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point   but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters   terry is a repessed   mournful character who wants to die   while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live   and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits   and where the straight laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character    this is by the numbers plotting   buddy movie road movie redux    however   dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline   but by the characters which carry the story   it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic   if not likeable    unfortunately   that is not the case here   where both of the film s leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying   giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights   and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits    far from a romp   this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt   and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond    mr   taylor s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes   while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone   it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived   witness such lines as   you should have asked something more interesting   like  do you enjoy the pain        see   that s provocative   leaves room for further questions        the film enjoys a few inspired moments   the urn scene   a session of nude bowling   the policeman joining in on terry and nick s acid trip   but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between   and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes    this occurs particularly often during the film s opening sequence   as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital   i m realising that this is   intended   to be funny   although nary a smile crept upon my lips   which is probably due to the obvious fact that it s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts   sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick s scheme of tricking him   this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes    the entire sequence is   then   clearly an exercise for character exposition   with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability    among the cast   coming off best is david arquette   the current master in the portrayal of meek   squirming   stammering fresh faced characters   he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang s swimming with sharks   who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry    mr   taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique   where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated   as opposed to a bright   crisp look for the smalltown scenes    the charge of dream with the fishes s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me   i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters   and indeed   in many cases have i been in the minority   supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult   audience unfriendly nature of their characters    for dream with the fishes   though   i did find myself on the flip side of coin   often hoping that the film would quickly conclude   and that the nick character would just hurry up and die

403	0	i m not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing   disturbing behavior   with   scream      maybe it s because they re both horror films   kinda     both have hot young stars   both have an annoying alternative soundtrack   and both are aimed at the teenage crowd   which i guess includes me    but this is not the next in line with the   scream   flicks as well as the   i know what you did last summer   soon to be flicks    it owes less to   halloween   and more to kafka and orwell   which   in my book   makes for a more interesting feature    and it should have been    this is basically a rehash of   the stepford wives     the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing   as i ve been told   with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives    or something like that       behavior     starring katie holmes of   dawson s creek     deals with a bunch of teenagers   deep in angst   who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers    suck ups    preppies    it actually   at least to me   sounds like it would work   and with scott rosenberg   that witty penmen who has written stuff like   beautiful girls   and   things to do in denver when you re dead     as well as   con air       it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit    alas   it s not   and it plumets into that little group of movies known as   the movies with potential that blow it      i remember a film called   white man s burden   which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it s potentially brilliant premise    here s another one    it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves    it s a stage   and this film does in fact realize that    it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly    now it just needs to work as a film    which it doesn t    it s too sloppy and too contrived    it paints a bleak portrait of high school life       then  lets it lie    it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes       then  gives it a cheap twist   when they get horny   they become homicidal    isn t it scary enough that they re like this   and can t the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them   not that you could be next to die    the film introduces us two three different characters who   in the beginning   are considered outsiders because they re not   yet   part of this clique   the new kid   steve   james marsden   dull dull dull dull     who s having trouble at home because he hasn t gotten over his brother s   ethan embry   in quick flashes so you don t recognize him   i did   suicide   the renegade girl   rachel   katie holmes   from   dawson s creek       who s chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring   and by far the most interesting kid   gavin   nick stahl   the kid from   the man without a face       who s the most interesting because he s the only character who s given some dimension    in the film s best scene   he introduces steve to every single clique   nailing each one s fetishes and hang ups   and it s the best scene in the movie because it s witty   satirical   and interesting   something the rest of this film isn t    gavin suspects there s something awry with the preppie kids   known as the blue ribbons   and in the tradition of all conspirators   and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve   he s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff    here   we have another case of   the idiot plot     where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him   but he may have saved this film from being the dreary   dull film that it is without gavin   who gives it life and humor    the only other half interesting character is the school janitor   played by william sadler as a retarded   scary guy who may not be what he seems to be       but  really   we don t care anyway    i probably shouldn t mention that this was directed by david nutter   who s works for   the x files     because that would probably tarnish his reputation    like the show   he s good at setting up weird conspiracies   and creating a general creepy feel    most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect   and some of it works    but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff    he keeps too much inside   so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act   you wonder why they just don t get the hell out of there    i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there s something rotten in the state of teen angstdom    what this film needs to be is a lot longer   a lot more colorful   and a lot creepier    if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor   played by bruce greenwood   an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent   who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed   then they need to come up with a tougher   smarter villain    if he s so villainous   then why could two dense teenagers who couldn t figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes    the film   which runs about 80 or so minutes   just needs to work on these things   and become a lot less sloppy    at such a short running time and with such lame   boring characters as these   it s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one s mouth   especially mine    
1804	1	the coen brothers are back again   this time with homer s   odyssey   as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in   o brother   where art thou      right for the beginning of   o brother   the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song    the camera flows around the hard toiling men   giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes   ulysses everett mcgill   george clooney     delmar   tim blake nelson   and pete   john turturro     escaping across a cotton field    it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio    a strong suite   as always with the coen brothers   is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films    their characters are goofy and comical   like nicolas cage in   raising arizona     or   dramatic   as albert finney and john turturro in   miller s crossing     and   even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in   fargo      in all cases   and in   o brother     too   the characters populating their films are three dimensional people    ulysses everett is a handsome   hair obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department    but   he seems like a genius when compared to the simple   sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete   who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of  1   2 million    their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer s original material as they meet all manner of people along the way   including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money    there is magic   too   when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens    the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys  adventures   giving the flick a choppy   episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow    some of the interludes are an epiphany   though    the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar playing tommy johnson   chris thomas king   and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere   run by its blind owner   stephen root      they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and   without their knowledge   are recorded as they sing the traditional tune     i am a man of constant sorrow      it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us   in my mind   the best movie song of the year    contrasting this and other wonderful moments   the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind   are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of   o brother      in particular   near the end   is a scene where ulysses   delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched    the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of   the wizard of oz      they don t say   lions and tigers and bears   oh my      and there s no dorothy   but it is the land of oz we re seeing here    the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels    george clooney is funny   charming   a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today    he has the charm of a 30 s movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity    ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair   risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets    his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero wanderer    while clooney is the name draw for   o brother     the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar    the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who   at one point   hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism    delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine    the taciturn pete   as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro   is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst    all together   the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons   albeit brave ones    the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys  odyssey    charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o daniel   who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re election    john goodman is wicked as the one eyed bible salesman and con artist   big dan teague    michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary   george   babyface   nelson    stephen root is amusing as the blind dj   rep ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways    holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses  estranged wife   penny   and the real reason for this adventure   not secret treasure      techs are   as expected in a coen brothers venture   first class    cinematographer roger deakins   who has worked on five previous coen films   captures the sultry atmosphere of the south    the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres   respectively    once again   roderick jaynes   the alter ego of ethan and joel coen   is on board as editor    the high points outweigh the low through most of   o brother   where art thou      with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music    i give it a b

1236	1	when i saw the trailer for   the sixth sense     i didn t expect much from it    my snap judgment was that it was a watered down version of   the shining   or possibly a late entry in the glut of angel related movies tv shows of a couple years ago    but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot    it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year    bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe    at the beginning of the movie   he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work   but he is soon confronted by vincent   a patient malcolm failed years earlier   donnie wahlberg former new kid in an impressive cameo      a year passes   and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed    cole sear   haley joel osment   is a withdrawn kid who is called   freak   by the other boys in the neighborhood    weird things seem to happen around cole his mother   olivia williams   leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn t moved and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn t for example   that there was once a gallows in his school    he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom    the trailer gave away the movie s first major plot twist    if it hadn t   the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn t know what s wrong with cole    if you re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer   stop reading this review right now and go see   the sixth sense      anyway   since the trailer gave it away   i figure it s fair game to discuss here    once malcolm gains cole s trust   cole reveals his secret   he sees ghosts everywhere    dead people wander around not knowing that they re dead   invisible to everyone except cole    malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth    the box office success of   the sixth sense   has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that s so    i hate to burst anybody s bubble   but   the sixth sense   isn t really a horror film    at its core     the sixth sense   is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally scarred adult help each other to move past their problems    some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy   though    one that really got to me   the ghost of a boy says to cole     i ll show you where my dad keeps his gun     when the ghost turns   we see the bullet wound in the back of his head    osment gives the best performance i ve ever seen from a child actor    it s hard enough to find a grown up in hollywood who can give a subtle   realistic portrayal    although willis gets top billing   cole is really the protagonist of the story   and osment truly brings the complex kid to life    if only willis  work were as impressive    accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue   willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm   his most challenging role to date       this is a bad omen for his next movie     the story of us     which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage      writer director m   night shyamalan has a light   poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite    he s also a skillful storyteller   as the movie s ending demonstrates    only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie    look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole    bottom line   osment should get an oscar nomination   and you should go see this movie    
108	0	in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa    the twilight murders   another one from the series   is dealing with the case of gordon kahl   played by rod steiger     old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u   s   government    after being released   he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest    when the u   s   marshals come to arrest him   it turns out that kahl isn t alone    many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti government beliefs   and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that    that brings fbi on the scene   and agent mayberly   michael gross   is supervising the manhunt    however   his efforts seem fruitless   since kahl still has many supporters   some of them even in the local law enforcement    after betrayed   1988 thriller by costa gavras   hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right wing extremism in the american northwest   and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing   when media hype brought right wingers back into spotlight    until that time   only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon    unfortunately   the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film   that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script    sometimes   like many american tv movies   it creates drama where drama shouldn t be    on the other hand   film is steadily directed by dick lowry   and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl    on the other hand   michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible    however   film does deal with potentially thought provoking social and political issues   so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn t be the total waste of time    
656	0	you think that these people only exist in the movies   but trust me   they re as real as life    i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person s brain with microwaves    then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections    i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted    these people had what are known as   conspiracy theories     ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public    a little imagination goes a long way    in richard donner s conspiracy theory   jerry fletcher   mel gibson   is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything    his latest   that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle   might sound outrageous to us   but is all in a day s work for him    he combs the newspaper   looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings on behind the scenes   and from there jerry draws his conclusions    upstanding citizen that he is   he tries to convince alice sutton   julia roberts   of the justice department that the president must be warned    lucky gal   alice   who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since    what she doesn t know is that jerry s interest in her is far more than   well   professional    he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment    but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry s ideas and his limited circulation   conspiracy theory   newsletter   he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice s help    one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action   nor a significant number of thrills    part of this is a result of the film s slow pace    it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice   and even once that is over with   the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement    at over two hours   this film could have been significantly condensed and had it s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour   but even then   the action scenes would not be able to save the film    instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces   we re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite   black elements     black helicopter   men in black action suits and body armor   black vehicles   you know the drill    they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons   but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time    big deal   we ve seen it all before    watching the film   i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination   but i was out of luck    now   when i say it took forever to set up the   relationship   between jerry and alice   i completely mean what one person is relative to the other   and not romantic involvement    oh   donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie   the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other   but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring    you see   there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies   also directed by donner   than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory    the two just don t click   and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether   like finding out he s been stalking her     the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced    the script in general also seems forced   like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it   then took it and forced it upon us    dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable   to the point that i almost stopped listening    even gibson s usual gift for ad lib couldn t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest   although one of jerry s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing    unfortunately   much of what s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what s going on   but instead filler that starts out with potential   but ends up just being extraneous because it s never followed through    for example   jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station    he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break   hence the water in a subway station     and that the coroner should check the man s lungs for chlorine    this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him    you know what happens then    nothing   zip   nada    no follow up whatsoever   so what s the significance    okay   here s another one    a couple of well known   real life   assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j   d   salinger novel   the catcher in the rye      jerry also has a bunch of copies    whenever he goes into a bookstore   he has to buy one    leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin   we re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin    not when we find out about his salinger collection   not when he goes to the bookstore   not later on when we get the answer to our first question    the point becomes totally extraneous    oh   did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film    yeah   he plays this government psychiatrist named dr   jonas who may or may not be a bad guy    that s about it    for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has   he s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory    you can just lump him in with the supporting players   with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi    this guy was really likable   and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time    okay   here s my theory    this really started out as a great film   but some of its jokes were actually true    the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security   and this was what was left over    
244	0	   spice world   is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls    sure there s a hint of humor in there every once in a while    actually   there s a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls    but overall   who cares    not me    if you don t know by now   the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power   yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood    in   spice world   they ride around in their big tour bus   whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews    amazingly   all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things   things they want to do   not things they are required to do to keep earning money    and they keep babbling about   girl power   when they should really be talking about   cleavage power      i mean   if all it takes is girl power   then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits    the film is pg   but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions   you d have yourself one raunchy adult film    by the way   there s something in the opening credits which says   based on an idea by the spice girls      wow   they got idea credit    i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood        giving credit for simply having the thought   say girls   let s make a movie      the supporting cast fares well    roger moore   the real james bond   mockingly plays the cliche spewing   chief   of the spice girls   and darn it all   he s fun to watch    mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band s manager   richard e   grant      one question though   george wendt    you d think that   spice world   would envoke one of two reactions in people    if you like the spice girls   you ll like them even more afterwards    and if you can t stand them   like me     then   spice world   will really make you sick    oddly   the audience i saw the film with   roughly 50 twelve year old girls   sat in silence for the entire film    well   not the two who sat directly behind me    they kept muttering   this is stupid   over and over again    maybe there is hope for humanity after all     pg

1149	1	the story of us   a rob reiner film   is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film   as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films    well   1999 has two of them   the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family   american beauty    the story of us   a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family   is a well written   heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience   including myself   cry    the story of us tells the story of ben   bruce willis   and katie   michelle pfeiffer   jordan   and asks the question     can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage      the film is about two individuals who have come together   spent a good chunk of their lives together   and shows when our main characters are   him   and   her     during the bad times     and when they are   us     during the good times      the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day    ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer   or at least say they don t   love each other anymore    ben   a cartoonist   and katie   a crossword puzzle writer   have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage   as they have grown to follow different views on life   family   and marriage    katie is the more organized   sophisticated type   who wants to plan everything out   while ben is a spontaneous   adventurous individual who doesn t mind doing things differently than they were planned    the story of us plays out nicely   as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist   told to the viewer through flashbacks    as the film progresses   it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist   with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage    this method is highly effective   as we see the characters changing from year to year   slowly growing apart    through the flashbacks   we get to see the story of them through both of the character s eyes   and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like   as the story of us has three dimensional   believable main characters    the screenplay   written by jessie nelson   stepmom   and alan zweibel   dragnet     is a touching   down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer   much like another one of nelson s films   stepmom    the script has an open honesty and outlook on life   one that is so realistic   you feel uncomfortable at many times   because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar   as most families these days most go through the hard times   as ben and katie must    if it wasn t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote   which are rugged and certainly flawed   the story of us would have been this year s best picture    bruce willis   a usual action adventure star   has certainly turned himself around in the past year  he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies   to a distinguished   sophisticated actor   as in last summer s the sixth sense   and now in the story of us   willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script    although i wouldn t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan   willis handles himself nicely   and shines in a few of the film s most powerful scenes   enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season    where to start about michelle pfeiffer    pfeiffer s performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong   as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion   you wonder how   how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism    pfeiffer s performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring   will be in the heart s of any viewer that has watched this moving film    the story of us is one of 1999 s most real   yet funny films   as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked    superb acting   direction   writing   story   and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film   which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman   make the story of us a touching   unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country  and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall    the film s major high points are the fights between ben and katie   as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed   and although they also say things like   it s over     or   i hate you     you can tell the two still share a deep connection   and that inside   somewhere   they are still an   us      the bottom line   a wonderful   enchanting   and heartbreaking film    one of the most realistic   heartbreaking films in recent years    
1835	1	seen february 15   1998 on home video   borrowed from chris wessell      when it comes to modern gangster movies   it s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and or just using the word   routine      i ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea   no matter how many times it s been used before   can provide for a good story and   donnie brasco   clinches this idea    it s not unlike most of the great films of the genre   yet it never apes another s style as it has a good layer of authenticity   even if its core is a tad stale    the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it    we meet lefty   pacino     an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk    he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this    somehow he comes across donnie brasco   depp     a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn t afraid of lefty and his rep   and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him    it s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately   telling him all the tricks of the trade    i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit    however   we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone   an fbi agent working undercover   a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer    the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor   a brief history of the mob   definitions of their slang   and where their money comes from and who it goes to    the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements   however   the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original    most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works   probably from watching other gangster movies     and although this attitude comes across   the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable    thankfully the film doesn t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime   and instead opts for character development    much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie    pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would    he s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does   just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be    we learn of his accomplishments   which are quite impressive within their context   and when he complains about not being made top boss   it s easy to sympathize with him    newell constantly plays up this aspect   making it a major theme which works well in the long run    as donnie is constantly impressing and even one upping lefty   it s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful   the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob   or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed    most of the film tells the story of donnie s life in mafia   which creates for many sub plots and individual conflicts   but doesn t always seem to come together as a whole    the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout   even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar    the resonance to donnie s actual assignment varies   he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress   but it doesn t always seem to have much meaning    back home   his wife maggie   heche   is ready to divorce him because he s never a and the family is suffering    since this is based on a true story i wouldn t doubt this would happen   although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic    my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act   or at least any real sense of closure    a climax of sorts does occur   but there s little feeling of a payoff    we get a happy ending   which is good   but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful    aside from a few minor   general flaws     donnie brasco   manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development    it may be routine   but it s good   and that s respectful

namesake s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug    the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together   not surprisingly since it s virtually the only object there    when he s denied any money   he picks up a replacement rug off the floor    on his way out   he runs into lebowski s trophy babe wife bunny   tara reid   who offers to perform a sexual act that   according to rumor   is one of bill clinton s favorites for a thousand bucks    the penniless dude wisecracks that he s heading for the cash machine    later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny s kidnappers    this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes gone wrong sequences    the kidnappers are impossibly inept    the dude and his cronies are even worse    every plan goes awry    you can almost see lebowski s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues    that s the story   but to tell the truth it doesn t much matter    there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining    the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into    the dude s bowling buddies walter   john goodman   and donny   steve buscemi   look like people you d see on the street but   like everything else in this film   they re not quite what they seem    walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties    everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam    when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won t admit it   walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet    donny gets precious few words in between walter s screaming and the dude s rambling    when he does   walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns    donny is   out of his league   and doesn t   have a frame of reference      the film is peppered with people for whom the term   character   would be an understatement    the big lebowski s daughter maude   an avant garde   vaginal   artist   paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s m mary martin    the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers    bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star    most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler    as the flamenco music swells   we see him putting on his lavender hose    the camera pans up to an all purple skin tight bowling outfit with   jesus     pronounced with a   j     not an   h     embroidered on the pocket    he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail    his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball    bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has    i can t think of anyone else who could have done a better job    buscemi has a limited role   but he plays it perfectly    the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he s one of the treasures of our time    it s odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr s television husband    more like the coen s   raising arizona   than their hit   fargo       the big lebowski   demands an open mind and even more open eyes    a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen   much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss    there s so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it    walking out of the theater   i felt that the film had something important to say    on further examination   i wasn t sure exactly what it was       if you meet jesus at the bowling alley   it s not going to be what you expect         when the going gets weird   the weird go bowling      maybe there s no real message    perhaps it s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world    maybe that s enough       michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about   the man in the iron mask   starring that favorite of 14 year old girls of all ages    redman bvoice   com is the eaddress for estuff      
393	0	yeah   yeah   the advertisements didn t even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook   sex    neve campbell and starship trooper s denise richards getting it on    ok    yeah   it s a decent two minutes of film erotica   but even if that s your main interest in this film   there s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes    wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however    nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing   or at least curious to see the next turn   throughout the entire movie    but this fast paced   razor sharp turning of events doesn t leave much time to enjoy the surprises    we start off in a high class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making    guidance counselor sam lombardo   matt dillon   seems to catch the eye of every student   particularly kelly van ryan   richards     daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts    right off the bat   kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce   mr   lombardo      the fund raiser car wash seems the opportune time   particularly when you wash your guidance counselor s jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you ll be soaked from head to toe when you re done    on the weekend of the car wash   kelly s attempts at seduction fall flat   and when they do   she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day    naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations    but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low class   marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller   campbell   comes forth with a near identical story   also involving her trusted guidance counselor    pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians   sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney   ken bowden   played by bill murray    yes   that bill murray    sound like a good   complete movie    yes   that alone could have been   but this is just the beginning    in fact   the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film    it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time    by the time the movie finishes   you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable    unfortunately   with so much going on   you re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about    this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could ve been    the 113 minutes fly by   and although it never feels underdeveloped   this pretzel of storytelling could ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken    the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime time soap operas   which no   is not a good thing    and it s not just campbell   who happens to hail from the prime time fox soap   party of five     but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones    dillon   who was so charming in his understated role in last year s in   out   gives the best performance   and murray s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film    in fact   if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy   even if it was the exact same film   i would actually give it a better grade    that s how cheezy it comes off    but aside from these two   the rest offer nothing more than some good eye full s    in the right hands   wild things could ve been a wickedly delightful   scrumptiously twisted thriller   but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting    and what s up with these people passing as high school students    i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles   but when i realized it wasn t supposed to be a college they were at   i had to snicker    i won t lie   this is definitely a guilty pleasure    as corny as it is   it s got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a   b   for effort    but if you just want to admire denise richards   go for last year s starship troopers   which was every bit as campy   but a million times better    of course   if seeing her breasts is your most important goal   you ll be right at home with wild things    perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters    
804	0	if you ve been following william fichtner s career   and there s absolutely no reason why you should have     you might have noticed that he s played some rather similar roles over the years    like sully in   the perfect storm     tough   gruff   and a little bit scary    or law in   albino alligator     tough   gruff   and little bit scarier    or colonel william sharp in   armageddon     or dwayne engelman in   strange days     or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of   pearl harbor     as the abusive father of danny  here is an actor who gravitates towards tough   gruff   hard hitting roles    which is why his performance in   what s the worst that could happen      is such a shock   such a delight    in the film   fichtner plays a blonde haired   meticulously dressed   overtly effeminate   dog loving detective    as alex tardio   fichtner s performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it    it borders on offensive but doesn t really manage it    and it borders on clich   d stereotype but doesn t quite succumb to that definition either    in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming   fichtner isn t perfect  you can see him struggling a little at times   concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air   or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal  but he s pretty damned good   and silly   and without question the best thing in the film    in fact   had it not been for fitchner s sudden and bizarre appearance   and his jarring screen presence thereafter   i would have walked out   for   what s the worst that could happen      is mesmerizing in its awfulness   a poorly written   haphazardly edited   and totally unfunny   yes   it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible      moviegoing experience    fichtner s performance doesn t exactly save the film   and it s not like i m recommending   what s the worst that could happen      solely on the strength of the actor s dramatic turnaround   but his contributions do raise the film s rating from no stars to one and a half    thumbs up to fichtner then   and thumbs down  way   way   down  to everyone else involved in this sorry mess   a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn t even warrant discussion    
535	0	keep cool   a chinese film directed by semi accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang   was one of the kickoff films for this year s hawaii international film festival    on the day it premiered   lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block   some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater    they need not have wasted their time    the movie is billed as a comedy   but is surprisingly bereft of humor    there are noticeable attempts at laughs   but very few tries actually click    i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn t getting because i m not from china   but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn t be attributed to the cultural barrier either    keep cool just isn t very funny    the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool s producer who   with the help of an interpreter   regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time   an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii    although the print made it   the assistant s luggage was lost    too bad that story wasn t in the movie   because it got a big laugh    qu ying   the film s female lead   was also on hand to give a few comments    however   whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed   ms   ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one   fast paced   incredibly long tirade    it was dizzying   good foreshadowing for the film    you see   keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes    at least that s the way it seems   since the camera is constantly moving    cinema verite is one thing   but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another    although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing   i found it thoroughly distracting   and after a while   quite annoying    headache   as i said    the film is about a young bookseller   wen jiang   who is after a young woman   qu ying      they used to be romantically involved   but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship    the first half of the film is about the young man s plan to win her back    of course the thing is   she doesn t want to be won back   and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit    in the fight   the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker   but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost    we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced    there is a funny scene   the only one in the film   where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner   baotian li   in order to recoup his losses    there is no sense to be made out of the young woman s behavior   cold one minute   caring the next   so we feel no sympathy for her character    the bookseller would be better off without her    although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well   who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner s hand as revenge for the beating he took   it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man    while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge   the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation    his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with   but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time    a friendship develops between the two men   but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate    although only an hour and a half in length   keep cool contains extraneous material    the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out   since we don t see her from the midpoint on    a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner   and would have saved us from the bookseller s boring pursuit during the first half    but of course   this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour    there are a few things that keep cool does right    as mentioned before   the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good    although it grows tiresome   the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic   and represents the differences in thinking between generations    in one scene   for example   the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across   but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted   and that it means something entirely different    also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene   such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner    the nightclub owner is counting out money   slapping each bundle of currency on the table    with every shot of his hand   we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge    unfortunately   these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film s shortcomings   and weren t enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater    
1718	1	while watching   shallow grave     i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens    blood simple      both are good films in which several characters   none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil   indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes    the body count rises   and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands    both films are also flawed   but for different reasons       blood simple   is unrelentingly dark and moody   but its characterizations were a little hollow       shallow grave     on the other hand   is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes   and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they d accomplished for a more standard   audience pleasing ending    the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time   yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end    as the film begins   we are introduced to alex   ewan mcgregor     juliet   kerry fox     and david   christopher eccleston     a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow    they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious   but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch    a man named hugo moves into the apartment s remaining vacancy   and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose    juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash   presumably from criminal activities      the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death   after a drawing of straws   the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david   who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning    all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film   and part of what makes   shallow grave   so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next    other than the obvious question of why they don t report the death and simply hide the cash   which is not addressed   the plotting and characterization   while sometimes predictable   worked in a way that kept my attention and   on more than one occasion   gave me chills    i will   therefore   attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn t give away too much of the plot    broadly   the trio are in danger due to hugo s underworld connections   as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process    a police inspector   ken stott   is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment   asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective    david   meanwhile   becomes increasingly paranoid   moves into the attic   and develops an affinity for sharp objects    director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment   and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other    while i do not consider myself the   happy endings are automatically stupid   type   i thought that   shallow grave   really should have ended in tragedy   a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison   in the mental hospital   or in the morgue    this could have been accomplished   quite credibly   but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional   caper   ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom   and nothing more    granted   this isn t really a   happy   ending   but it s still pretty light hearted compared to what preceded it    i really shouldn t say anything more about the ending as far as details go   but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable    yes   this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes   but ultimately it left me feeling as if i d been cheated    still     shallow grave   was brilliant most of the way through   and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller   and i am therefore awarding it three stars    i guess i just can t help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away

1122	1	in brief   best bleak comedy film since heathers    full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture    go see it    so   i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on   hard copy   with pam smart   the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980 s       hard copy    s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for    smart replied that she thought kidman s character came off as a dumb   vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal       smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband      smart s got a point    it wouldn t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version    however   given a choice between the mass media  happening  of the real event and the fictionalized movie   i would definitely opt for the later    real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart   while pretty and alluring   is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman    to die for begins in a town called little hope   new hampshire   the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb    the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being  on tv      of course   one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry   played by matt dillon    but   with a little imagination   some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement   our heroine manages to overcome the nay sayers in her life   at least temporarily    kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne    i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture    her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates    kidman knows a star making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven   post feminist uber temptress from hell    she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue   which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way    at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister in law       you know     she knowingly exclaims     gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever   if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head      her husband beams at suzanne s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters    this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven   folks    the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix    he plays jimmy   a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne s sexual favors    kidman s character   vapid though she is   is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia   winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland    phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen x slackerhood   as envisioned by tabloid tv   of course      his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain t going anywhere   ever    phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne   someone who actually noticed him    gus van sant   drugstore cowboy   my own private idaho   direction is first rate    he keeps the pacing in this not quite thriller snapping along    van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions    van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to  get it  without stopping to explain what is funny about this all american story    the screenplay   by buck henry   is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i ve heard since heathers    henry s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame   yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters    henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini classic    danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric   loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands    either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick or treat parties    all in all   a wonderful production   well worth your seven bucks    to die for   a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant    written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman   matt dillon   joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard    rated r   for language and mature themes       respect the r   not for under 14 s   rating       stars    go see it

1105	1	i think that any competent member of the human race who s ever seen a movie  any movie  could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer    even though i try very hard to not predict films as i m watching them   especially not romantic comedies     the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds   and sometimes minutes   before i actually saw it happen on screen    but i don t care    not even a little    my reasons for this are simple   1   adam sandler is great    2   drew barrymore is great    3   the movie is so funny    there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard    i haven t laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers    sandler plays robby hart   a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music    in the opening scenes   he seems like a happy go lucky wedding singer   at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual   steve buscemi   who decides that his brother s wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life   up to that point   was utter pointlessness    a week later   at his own wedding   he is left standing at the altar by his ex fianc   e   linda   angela featherstone      with his life in complete disarray   he meets julia   barrymore     a waitress    she is engaged to glenn   matthew glave     and is to marry him in about three months    julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans    soon   and predictably   it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk   and that robby and julia really love each other    oh sure   it s trite    and if anyone making this film expected us to   like   feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer   then they truly underestimated their audience    what makes the story bearable   aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music   are the performances    barrymore is simply adorable here   i ve never seen her look so close to the way she did in et      not only is she pleasant to look at   but her acting job here really is a good one  and it doesn t hurt that the character is likable and adequately well written    and the jerk   played in full force by graves   is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i ve ever seen    naturally   the true star here is sandler    i think the guy is flat out hilarious    he can say something that just isn t funny   and his delivery makes me laugh    his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore   but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can   indeed   hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy    whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler   the wedding singer gives him a character that   for the first time   he actually has to fit into    as far as i m concerned he succeeded   and this film is testimony that he does   in fact   have some range in his talents    and the movie is just so funny    perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc   e abandoned him    this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air    and while the film   like all romantic comedies   takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up   there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half    my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren t very important    the film is predicable   but who cares    the characters are extremely likable   the movie is ridiculously funny   and the experience is simply enjoyable    in addition to this   i can t imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film    in that order   i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review    i just want everyone to know that i laughed    a lot    
1572	1	plot   a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum    as each day passes   the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion    saying anything else about the plot would be a crime    have fun        critique     i feel like shooting myself in the head   are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie   a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here    this ain t your average   happy go lucky   kind of picture    this is a deliberately slow paced mystery horror film drenched in atmosphere   with a very creepy insane asylum   in which most of the film takes place     very few clues up front and lots to talk about afterwards    will it bore some people to sleep    you bet it will    is it made for the scream audiences of the day    absolutely not    i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the   cerebral crowd      a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame   giving away very little with each step and each sound   unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later    i ve always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group    in fact   i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a   mindfuck      if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly   gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds   tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together   well   then this movie is definitely for you    it s the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate   damn   i missed that whole   peanut butter   thing     and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark       brrrrrrrrr       now  what was that sound in the basement    honey   can you go check      and one thing this film doesn t have   unlike its hollywood ian counterparts like the haunting   is special effects    in fact   that s one of the greater things about this movie   it feels real because it looks like it s actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances   i did some research and it was   in fact   shot on digital video       ah ha        another great thing about it is that it s actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme   and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen   it s mostly implied   kids        and as clich   d as it might be to say       it s usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such    other films that this one reminded me of include henry   portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project   with that same real sense of dread   brooding and terror    the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don t get   into   it completely   you really need to concentrate here     you will lose the motion of the story and the pent up tension might be released    but overall   this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight    and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can   how can you go wrong    definitely not a film for everyone but a must see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed   count me in        stanley kubrick would be proud    oh yeah       so  where s that gun again          where s joblo coming from    the blair witch project   4 10     blair witch 2   7 10     the haunting   3 10     the house on haunted hill   7 10     lost highway   10 10     the pledge   6 10     the shining   9 10     the sixth sense   8 10     unbreakable   8 10    
491	0	the u   s   army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done    one particular field manual is known as the fm 22 5   which among other things   covers the practice of saluting    under the   saluting   section is a sub section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer    the salute is rendered by the highest ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail   and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail    in any event   the salute is rendered only by the man   or woman   in charge   rather than by the whole group    almost at the very beginning of the general s daughter   we see a general s motorcade passing a work detail    everyone salutes    it looked impressive   but it just wasn t right    that little bit showed me that someone either didn t do the appropriate research   or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene    in fact   this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture   as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie    what results is a film that looks good   but like that one scene   just isn t right    the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example    paul brenner   john travolta   is an agent for the army s criminal investigation division   undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale    prior to the transaction   the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn t the unscrupulous supply sergeant he s supposed to be   and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living    so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark   we ll just say that it involves propellers      brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general s daughter   captain elisabeth campbell   leslie stefanson     is found naked   bound   and dead on one of the base s training ranges    he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill   madeleine stowe   to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder    what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary    it gives no insight into brenner   other than the fact that he s a little cocky    does the arms subplot turn up later    no   so why add this extra running time to the film    the answer   it looked cool    or how about the   atmosphere      the beginning of the general s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south   thick trees   dirt roads   sultry colors over water   all backed up with bayouesque music    nice immersion in the setting   but it soon doesn t matter   for when the film s plot shifts over to the murder investigation   so does the entire mood    no attention is paid to the location of the story   and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme    did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie    instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film   we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another   just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside    the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie    as i ve already mentioned   an entire section of the film doesn t jibe with the rest   and the characterization only adds to the difficulty    brenner   who comes across as a man with little respect for authority   suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell   james cromwell   and utters some of the corniest   yes   sir   s i ve ever heard    he even delivers an emotion charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general s daughter   even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous    sunhill   who initially comes across as a professional investigator   utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information   and even revels in her ingenuity    both characters are protagonists   but it s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place   and in some cases   simply unappealing    i could imagine that during filming   west would shoot a scene   then take the actors aside and tell them     let s do it again   but this time   i want more      i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good   in this film they overact in most of their scenes    an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general s aide   colonel fowler    i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention    a far cry from his days as linc in   the mod squad     i can t help but think he was acting from west s direction    a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist   john beasly   and a young female private   ariyan a   johnson   make their scenes nearly impossible to bear    the only two actors who seem to have escaped west s influence are james woods   who provides a good performance as colonel moore   elisabeth s mentor at the psychological operations unit   and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police    woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people s minds   and does so without ever taking it over the top    hutton just kind of hangs around   but at least he wasn t overacting    i haven t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based   but i ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form    the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space   or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished    every time we re presented with some new aspect to the case   west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it s the most momentous discovery ever   but the information is not used by the investigators at all    instead   when conclusions are drawn   they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts   but lucky guesses instead    the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill   letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects   then letting them guess who the killer was    would ve been over in a half hour    the film finishes with a sort of bookend   featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning    literally during the closing credits   we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off   then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off    they both seem kind of happy    maybe they were driving away from simon west    
404	0	in the interest of being generous   i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black    sir anthony hopkins   playing a super rich media mogul   has gathered his family around him for dinner    his oldest daughter   played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing     who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party   presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes   which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake    the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes    hopkins   frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair   does what any man in his position would do   he punts    whichever one you like   dear   he says    and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do   she cries    i liked that scene for two reasons    first   the cakes looked really cool    second   it was   perhaps   the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act    meet joe black is chock full of odd performances   people doing things for no discernible reason at all   and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot    it s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani   but it s even easier to sleep right through it   two people on my row managed it quite nicely      the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess    i know my audience had problems with the movie   because they thought it was a comedy    case in point   everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie    however   the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani       it s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death   but it makes a certain kind of sense      it shouldn t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr   pitt    and indeed they do   after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt     because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished    well   when that happened   the audience howled with laughter   and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous    so   if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing room humor are funny   i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately    anyway   the deceased lawyer s body   no worse the wear from its massive injuries   is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role    the idea is that death   given the pen name of joe black   so as not to disturb others   wants to take a holiday and experience the world    if this weren t hollywood   we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death   but since it is   we get scene after scene of fish out of water humor   just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn t know how to act in our society    it also doesn t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently    he claims to be on vacation   but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani   just try to get your travel agent to book that one      he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois    he knows everything about some characters   nothing about others    and as played by brad pitt   he s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing   he s just there    it s as if someone told pitt     never mind about acting in this picture   son   just stand there and look pretty      it s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie    i ve used the phrase   angel of death   in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt s performance with this year s best angel performance   nicolas cage s in city of angels    where pitt is cold and unfeeling   cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows    where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man   pitt is aloof and arrogant    cage struck instant chemical sparks with co star meg ryan   where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani s character is so shallow that she can t see beyond pitt s good looks    the movie s other top name is a much better actor   but that doesn t save meet joe black    sir anthony hopkins isn t given much better material to work with   unfortunately    he plays one of these good hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood       one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins s character more realistically evil      hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker   but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world    of course   no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder    but i have to wonder   and in this movie   you have a very long time to wonder   how you or i would act in a similar situation   especially if you or i were a multimillionaire    hopkins pretty much goes to the office    and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation    fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated   i m sure    i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black   and i m asking myself why    movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest   which is what i m going to do now    go spend time with your family   go volunteer for a local charity   heck   go take a nap    don t go see meet joe black   because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death       curtis edmonds     no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it

1213	1	with the success of the surprise hit alien   directed by ridley scott   a sequel was inevitable    in fact   after watching the first film   a sequel was wanted   particularly by this reviewer    handing over the director s chair to recent box office gem james cameron   who had only made two films previous to this one   pirahna ii   a surprisingly dull film   and terminator   making cameron a household name     the alien series got a face lift of immense proportions    instead of being a suspense science fiction film   cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture    what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created    a film like aliens comes along only once in a while   and when it does   audiences are usually unprepared for it    i never saw this movie in theaters   but i wish i could have    the terror and fright must have been unimaginable   most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear    aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen    with a science fiction plot   cameron gives aliens added testosterone   pumping up the action and fire power from the original film    in fact   aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original    perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero  or heroine   as the case may be    never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film   and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character    sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about    placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual   but because of weaver s presence   a woman is the only suitable hero    aliens begins 57 years after alien ended    lieutenant ellen ripley   weaver   is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened    she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens   but   the company   is doubtful    they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left    despite stern warnings from ripley   the company remains rigid and won t call the families back    however   when the company loses contact with the colony   ripley s story seems much more feasible    one of the company s directors   carter burke   paul reiser     wants to gather a team to travel to the planet    this team includes a buff private vasquez   jenette goldstein     a questionable corporal hicks   michael biehn     and a loyal android bishop   lance henriksen      burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony    arriving on the planet   the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon type environment    the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca   newt   jorden   carrie henn      ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become   and she becomes newt s surrogate mother    ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened   and soon   all hell breaks loose    aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott s version   it also multiplies the number of aliens in general    alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member   except ripley   who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo    aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens   and as a result   the chills are incredibly heightened    then again   this is james cameron   the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2   judgment day    he is the best action director out there   topping renny harlin   who directed cliffhanger     and only he could create something as terrifying as this film    it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes   and aliens has the motherload    with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film   aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion    i can t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout   never dropping for a moment    just when you think the movie is over   something else will occur   and it starts right back up again    with a seemingly endless conclusion   aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history    this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film   as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen    using flawless special effects   the climax is exhausting   leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety    of course   for a film of this genre to work properly   the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see    aliens is completely realistic   even a decade after its initial release    the special effects are wonderfully seamless   with a terrifying alien to go with them    one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music   composed by cameron regular james horner    horner has created a terrific score   receiving an oscar nomination for his work    not only that   horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film   or science fiction film ever   and that includes 2001   a space odyssey   which was mainly a compilation of well known composers      in fact   the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music    the production design is incredible   which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy    dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive   but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well lit locations    normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer   aliens uses lights to scare the viewer    then   of course   is the cinematography   which uses point of view shots   along with video feeds in order to build suspense    some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley    surprisingly   the acting is not only above average for this genre   but some of the best    sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley   incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard edged persona    weaver soars above the rest in this film   but she is supposed to    carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child   developing a three dimensional character from her quiet attitude    lance henriksen is terrific as bishop   showing that androids don t always have to be flat characters    jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role   and steals several scenes of her own   though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn t fighting      michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film    however   biehn does a good job   making it seem original again    paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director   but reiser manages to pull it off quite well   however   i still see him as paul on tv s   mad about you        a very good cast   which also includes bill paxton and william hope   highlights this action film   making it stand out from others    aliens is rightfully rated r for violence   gore   language   and terror    aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre   as alien was more of a suspense horror film    aliens pumps up the stakes   and cameron directs it with professional quality    cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film   but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen    technically astonishing   aliens  only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed    aside from this   you probably won t experience anything like aliens for quite a while    
764	0	if you re going to make a two hour hollywood in joke   why bother releasing it to the general public    if you re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big name actors and people who know woody allen   then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters    while watching celebrity   i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people    what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self deprecation    celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself   living in a world that he s familiar with   dealing with people like the ones he actually knows    allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture   in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more    branagh plays lee simon   a journalist turned screenwriter who divorces his wife   robin   judy davis     shacks up with some hot women   famke janssen   charlize theron   winona ryder     and goes about trying to get big stars   melanie griffith   leonardo dicaprio   to read his script about an armored car robbery    the usual elements of recent allen films are all here   including the sexual insecurity of the main character   lots of self loathing women   and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another    unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally   it s not likely that you ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity    aside from all the in jokes   the story falls far short of compelling   and the characters are all empty and lifeless    branagh proves once again that he s a superb performer   nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly    the problem is that he s the same character allen always plays   a character who s getting more than a little dull to watch    i mean   come on   how many times have you seen this guy       he hates his work   and he can t be satisfied by any one woman   and   at the end of the movie   nothing has been solved    he brings all of his problems upon himself   crashing his car because he s receiving fellatio   and other such stunts     so it s pretty hard to care about him    in addition   isn t allen capable of creating characters who aren t just like him    i know he is   but he didn t do it in celebrity    the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances    davis   playing the same woman with low self esteem that she played in deconstructing harry   has a few touching moments   but ends up the same despicable celebrity type that fills the rest of the movie    some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty    theron and ryder   especially    but they re not likable people    only famke janssen   as a book editor interested in simon s new novel   has any life    the men in the picture don t do much better    joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin   while dicaprio   as a christian slater johnny depp type spoiled young actor   is funny but disengaging    what s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its   themes   are    allen seems to think that he s making an insightful movie about the way   normal   people look at celebrities    the main problem with this is that the character with whom we re supposed to identify   simon   is not a   normal   guy    he s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters    the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us    none of them register as realistic   interesting characters   they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue    in addition   allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly   robin   in this scene   says something like     it s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate          celebrity is arguably allen s biggest misfire to date    it does have a few good scenes    theron s super orgasmic model character is kind of funny   and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two    but celebrity is a failure at the core   unless allen s point was to make a self indulgent movie about himself and his friends    if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke   then he succeeded in that    i   for one   don t enjoy feeling like an outsider    
1931	1	one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made     se7en   is just a few steps away from brilliance    however   those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss    the film received mixed reviews upon release   but there s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice    at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing   but the script and the ultimate pay off are excellent    the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable    this piece of work is 100  intensity    it s uncomfortable to watch   yet compelling       i want not to look   yet i cannot turn away      the story creeps along slowly and deliberately   crafted by visionary director david fincher    he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions   but not giving away too much too soon    this is the guy who directed the ominous   alien 3         se7en   is even more ominous because the threat is real    it s human and   while the script takes some artistic licence   the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic    that is   if a human being could be so intelligent   patient   wealthy   and disillusioned    after the most bizarre opening credits i ve ever seen   refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment     the initial character development takes place    morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset   a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society    brad pitt co stars as detective david mills   the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys    these two fine actors give the film its human qualities   along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow   who plays tracy   mills  wife      however   none of them stands out above the material    no disrespect intended   but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same    an ironic note is that somerset has only a week   or 7   that s seven   days   left on the force to train his young protege    the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins   as chronicled by john milton in   paradise lost     gluttony   greed   sloth   lust   pride   envy     wrath    incidentally   i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found    it s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking   but i won t give that away    as i said   this has a great ending and no one should spoil it    anyway   the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the   sinners   suffer for it    the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man    they learn that he was murdered  forced to eat himself to death    the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and   of course   somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way    if they didn t   it would be one short movie    the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story    we see a lot of blood   but it s not especially violent    the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown  like most of the violence in   pulp fiction         se7en   is gory   graphic   and disturbing   but all the gore is post death    still   if you tend to get queasy   don t eat food during this film    kevin spacey plays john doe   the avenging angel who claims that he s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings    like many crazy men   he has some fine ideas   but some sick ways of expressing himself    spacey doesn t appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn t receive billing in the opening credits    however   it s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination    a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not    this character is so well written that it s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone    no serial killer has ever been so creative       se7en   is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it s often a little too depressing    what it lacks in those areas   it makes up for with believable dialogue   top notch screenwriting   unexpected twists   and realistic characters    the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive    fincher uses lighting   music   and editing quite well   but his story is always the thrust of the film    fortunately   we don t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits   which are run backwards up the screen        it s better to imagine what paths they will follow    this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget    it s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing  the evils of the world aren t going to cure themselves       se7en   raises some tough questions and it s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves    useless trivia  co stars in 1995 s   se7en     brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar  pitt in   12 monkeys     spacey in   the usual suspects     for which he won

1787	1	when andy leaves for cowboy camp   his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys    one of these toys is wheezy   a penguin with a broken squeaker    woody   tom hanks   saddles up andy s dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy    woody succeeds in his mission   but doesn t make it back to the house before al   the unscrupulous owner of al s toy barn   recognizes woody as a rare collector s item and steals him    buzz lightyear   tim allen   leads hamm   john ratzenberger     mr   potato head   don rickles     slinky dog   jim varney     and rex   wallace shawn   into the city to find their friend    meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped    al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950 s tv puppet show   woody s round up   except for a woody doll    now that the collection is complete   al plans to sell woody and his round up gang bullseye the horse   jessie the cowgirl   joan cusack     and stinky pete the old prospector   kelsey grammer    to a toy museum in japan    the gang is happy about the move   they ve been in storage for years waiting for woody    if woody doesn t go with them   they ll be closed up in a dark box again   possibly forever    trying to convince him to stay with them   jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up   and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered    while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy   buzz and the boys invade al s toy barn   where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn t know he s a toy    the new buzz generates the movie s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on   zurg s fortress     i   e     al s apartment building      the original   toy story   won me over because its central themes reflected a grown up sensibility rather than the usual this is what we think kids want to hear    while most kids  movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill   in   toy story   buzz discovered that he wasn t special   that he was just like everyone else    buzz sank into a suicidal depression   but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy    in other words   it s okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life    most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we re not space rangers and we re never going to be       toy story 2   addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie    woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded   abandoned   or sealed up in a dark box in the attic    this is another big grown up theme   everything ends    the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody s arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp    on the shelf   woody meets wheezy   who s dusty   broken   and forgotten    the other toys are shocked that woody has been   shelved     and they worry that woody s ride out to the 25 cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt    after he s stolen   woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals    of course   in spite of the heavy themes   toy story 2   explores   it s also very funny    most of the laughs come from the toys  assault on al s toy barn and on the apartment building    the brief substitution of a new   still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise   i d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original    most of the vocal performances are first rate    tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work    however   one voice over also stands out as horribly miscast    kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector    although he does a lot of voice over work in commercials and on   the simpsons     as sideshow bob     grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice    he doesn t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete    the animation is even better than in the first    especially impressive were the textures of the figures    we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic   in the first movie the people looked just like the toys   but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint    we can also see that bo peep is porcelain    as you can tell from the long winded phrasing common in the merchandising      disney and pixar s  toy story 2       this is pixar s coming out party    to celebrate they appended their first project   a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball   to the beginning of the movie    they made the short in 1986   which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then    on the downside     toy story 2   follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale   and some sections tend to drag    overall   though   i had a great time and found   story 2   to be a worthy successor to the first   toy story      bottom line   this one really is fun for the whole family    
1670	1	in december of 1996   a little movie called   scream     was released   became a box office smash   and resurrected films targeted at teens    first   it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad   both   scream   movies     i know what you did last summer       urban legend     etc       but just recently   the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre   a  la  80s john hughes     starting with last june s   can t hardly wait      it may be the first week of april in 1999   but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25 and under market almost every single week     varsity blues       jawbreaker       cruel intentions       simply irresistible       the rage   carrie 2     and   the mod squad      coming april 9 are two more of this type     never been kissed   and   go     and on april 23   we ve got the teen satire   election   and the teen horror comedy   idle hands      jeesh    out of all of these moves   however   the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation     10 things i hate about you     is this past january s mediocre   ho hum   she s all that      although similar in plotting   ok   darn near identical       10 things i hate about you     a modern day version of shakespeare s   the taming of the shrew       she s all that   got its inspiration from   pygmalion       is an infinitely superior film in every department   from the smart direction by first time feature director gil junger to the charming and well written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast   who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985 s   the breakfast club      and to top it all off   in the inevitable climax set at the prom   at least we didn t have to once again suffer through a goofy   inappropriate dance sequence   who could forget   or want to remember   for that matter   this ludicrous development in   she s all that          the day wide eyed   shy new student cameron james   joseph gordon levitt   starts school at seattle based padua high   he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore   bianca stratford   larisa oleynik      although he doesn t know french   he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her   but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father   larry miller   won t allow her to date until her bitter   unconventional older sister   kat   julia stiles     a senior   decides to    kat   of course   has sworn off the likes of boys   but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her   which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona   heath ledger      complicating matters   cameron s dorky friend   michael   david krumholtz     decides to use a wealthy jock   joey   andrew keegan     who also has his sights set on bianca   as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him   and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey    as you can see     10 things i hate about you   includes a huge number of characters   some of which i haven t even mentioned   such as kat s shakespeare obsessed friend   mandella   susan may pratt   and bianca s materialistic comrade   chastity   gabrielle union      at a short   but well used running time of 98 minutes   all of the characters are perfectly handled   satisfyingly developed   and   for the most part   are not treated as caricatures   another flaw of   she s all that     where the bad guys   and gals   ran around constantly saying     you re vapor        since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters   and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective   i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained    aside from a good screenplay   it s the performances that can make or break a movie   and director junger has really hit the jackpot    aside from joseph gordon levitt     3rd rock from the sun       who gives his strongest performance to date here   none of the actors are that well known   but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings    as the main character of kat   julia stiles   last seen in the miniseries   the  60s     is marvelous and always believable   and certainly has a bright future ahead of her    even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard edged   it was easy to identify with kat s way of thinking   she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath     and i completely admired her individuality    no one   i think   could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does    heath ledger   as the infamous bad boy of the town   injects much life into patrick   and has a lot of chemistry with stiles    one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who   with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith   is able to turn bianca into a person with multi dimensions   even though she is accurately self centered at the on set    in one truthful scene   cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish   and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes   she has    one off beat element of the film   and a source of some hearty laughs   is the way that the school s staff act   which is strikingly unformal    allison janney   as the guidance counselor ms   perky   who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel   is comic dynamite   as is daryl   chill   mitchell as the english teacher   who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and   at one point   sends kat to the office because   for once   she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good    although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning   most of it actually works   especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters    in one very funny scene   chastity asks     i know people can be overwhelmed   and they can be underwhelmed   but can people just be       whelmed      at another point   bianca and kat s father   a stand out larry miller     who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant   only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion   before she leaves   she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it s like to be pregnant       10 things i hate about you   once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre   and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the  90s    it also helps that the movie has a perfectly assembled soundtrack   mixing indie rock with new wave  80s songs   and with   thank goodness   no rap      by the film s end   it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together   and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up   especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca   kat

would be able to find ten things i hate about   10 things i hate about you     but the positive aspects of the film far out number ten    
1110	1	it s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year   but that is what disney and pixar animation   s latest film represents    while a bugs life isn t nearly as deep as it s predecessor   dreamwork s antz   it is just as funny    a bug s life centers   appropriately   around the life of an ant   named flik    flik   cutely voiced by newsradio s david foley   hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task    when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost   the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way    the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them    the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper   who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey    when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food    when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission   they never dream he will be successful   they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food    flik s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return    instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs   who he mistakenly assumes are warriors    when he returns with the  warriors    the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes    a bug s life has animation that is simply stunning    the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative    together with the great voice acting   this film is the perfect holiday family film    its main weakness is that it couldn t beat antz to the theaters   making it seem like stale material

952	0	the most interesting part of   can t hardly wait   just happens to be not only the most human   but for many of us   the one part that many of us can easily relate to    that is the character of denise   lauren ambrose     the film s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film   and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored    the film wisely holds over this moment   nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party       almost  too nicely    for some members of the audience   read   me     this is basically a mirror of what s going on with them watching this film    we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place    i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this    after all   this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with    everyone s here   the jock   the homecoming queen   the nerd   and his dominions of trekkies and x philes     the alienated wannabe writer   the school spirit girl   the pothead   s     the wigger   etc   etc   etc   and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial   lame   and basically as a bunch of losers    except for denise   who rolls her eyes at everything   and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks   her yearbook entry   something which is done for each main character   quotes oscar wilde   definite pointers there      unfortunately   the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film    the film   as i said   portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything    however   instead of sticking with this   perhaps even going a bit further with it   they let this lie   and actually make these characters into our heroes    we follow several of them   all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism   and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and or identified with them    and if we did   we certainly don t want to revisit that state of being    here s a quick low down   it s graduation   and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night   otherwise known as the   american grafitti   or   to a lesser extent   the   dazed and confused   cliche    the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly   the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party       can t hardly wait   just opts for a big indoor keg party   and a little bit of aimless driving   albeit of the i m whining because i can t get a girl i want brand    we follow many people around   but mostly we trail preston   ethan embry   of   that thing you do         the alienated writer   who s been pining over the homcoming queen   amanda   the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt     for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart    now that she s broken up with her football player boyfriend   mike   peter facinelli     he decides to go to the party with a note he s written declaring his   love   for her in the hopes he ll build up the guts to give it to her       even  though he s leaving for a multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut   okay   the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson        since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film   and because it s a party   there are some more main characters   such as   william   charlie korsmo   finally surfacing after   dick tracy       the nerd   and his dominions   who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike   who s humiliated him for years   but gets too caught up in drinking to do it   kenny   seth green     the wigger   who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid   uh huh     and denise   the only exceptional character   who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom   don t ask   with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile    ugh    the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not   american grafitti   or   dazed and confused     two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers   not to mention were extremely entertaining     but to john hughes films of the 80s   most notably   sixteen candles      the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters   and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion    this film forgets to satirize its characters   and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes       and  then says that it s all okay    we can t take this film seriously   nor can we take this as fun   so really what good is it    but i will tell you some things i did like   i liked the direction   except for a couple too over the top features   like way too glossy jump cuts   it s like an oxymoron   and other obscurities    generally   though   elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement   and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time   a thing with a note   though   is too hokey to really be admirable      i actually did like seth green   for once in about a decade   when he played a very young woody allen in   radio days       his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable       almost    and   of course   lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise   the one character we could have used some more of   even though it would have changed the entirety of the film    however   the character of denise really doesn t work with the film   when really thought about    she s far too witty and realized   at least for the first half   to belong in this film   and whenever she appears   she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone    she s not just the cynic or the intellectual   she s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters    she may ruin the film more   but at least when she s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves   well   at least we ll be entertained      a couple other things that just don t work   mike s character   who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything   too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general   the aimless   bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda   give me a break   and perhaps the one thing that just doesn t work at all   jenna eflman s uncredited cameo as an angel   just didn t work   but nice try    basically the worst thing about this film   the real reason i m giving this such a low rating   is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we d do    we don t feel for these characters because for most of us   we aren t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots    the acid test for high school movies is   does it at all capture the feel of what it s portraying    the answer for this film is no    nice try   though

1863	1	an indian runner was more than a courier    he   became   the message he was carrying    what danger is a bear   to a message    i used to think sean penn was an immature   arrogant   photographer  punching   madonna marrying   loudmouth    but all that has changed now    the guy has grown up    and that s not all    it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director   if this film is any indication    one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo   given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper    but   no    this film is about a real struggle   and the victories and defeats are not simple    penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters   without unnecessary rush or flash    the focus of the story is two brothers    david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised   tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer    viggo mortensen is the wild brother   whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can t name   much less resolve    the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam   and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line    it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared    the film is unobtrusive   simple   direct   plain   and sincere    it isn t exactly perfect   but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them    life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems    this is a good film without big budget sets   or big name stars pushed into your face    in fact   i m reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing    there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw    i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified   though there are a few free form sections which also work very well    the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche   but what are you going to do  this movie   does   take place in the 1960s after all    in my opinion   it is worth full price admission    
386	0	it s actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i   the phantom menace   because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy    and no   i really don t feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box office    really   i don t    not at all    the plot has been done before    a mysterious   unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town   causing confusion for everyone who reads it    the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen   kate capshaw   and by the way   what is it with bookstore owner main characters    in the past year and a half we ve seen them in life is beautiful   you ve got mail   this movie   and the upcoming notting hill     who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore    she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from   and comes to the   incorrect   conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott    he   reading the letter himself   assumes that she wrote it for him    after a while   they fall in love   well   duh      kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her   and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman   tom selleck      to add to her turmoil   her mother shows up   blythe danner   who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9   and her trusted bookstore manager   deadpan ellen degeneres   quits    supporting characters aren t called supporting for nothing    their purpose isn t just to move the plot along   they re also supposed to give the storyline a backbone    to do this   they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting    rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed   dull   cardboard secondary characters   especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist s various interactions with them    this is the love letter s damning error    capshaw s character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies   but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one dimensional    because of that   the love letter is awkward and insincere    even worse    it s a bore    i liked capshaw and her helen   but everyone else is painfully fake   undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist    there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either    and besides degeneres  wisecracks   there s little that is even a little amusing    this is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter ho sun chan does a good job of portraying helen s yearnings and various subtle complexities    but it s far from profound    there isn t a common theme running through the proceedings   thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless    really   this is a harmless little movie   it s far from an abomination and it s not torturous to sit through    but bad   it is    awful   it also is    the love letter is a failure   and an inane failure at that       1999 eugene novikov  137

1826	1	in may of 1977   just 2 years after steven spielberg s success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas  the godfather   a risky   ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success    little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film    in january of this year   lucas re released star wars on its 20th anniversary    in this new   remastered version   the added effects   which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer generated jabba the hutt   don t do much but call attention to themselves    other than these   the film is exactly the same    why pay to see it in the theaters   you might ask    simply because when this movie was released   most of us were a few years short of being born    we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience   especially if you haven t seen it    the plot is basic but in the same way   complex    it has many themes   but the one rotates around luke skywalker   mark hamill   and his quest to become a jedi knight    his mission begins when a droid named r2 d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia   carrie fisher     which tells him to contact the mysterious obi wan kanoby   alec guiness      he and kanoby then   joined by two inter galactic renegades   hans solo   harrison ford   and chewbacca   and skywalker s two droids d2 and c3po   the voice of anthony edwards     wage war upon the corrupt empire   commanded by an evil general   peter cushing   and the traitorous darth vader   the voice of james earl jones      skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger   the force    the film is obviously quite star studded    but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones  voice would appear so many more times in the future    it just happened to work out for him    the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker s triumph is symbolized by the audience s sense of becoming something larger than life itself a universe of fans   young and old   recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever

1423	1	ladies and gentlemen   1997 s independence day is here    it s title   starship troopers    and surprisingly   it is more entertaining than id4    i realize that i gave last year s sci fi hit a 4 star rating   but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour    after subsequent viewings   i feel that independence day really wasn t as great as it seemed  though i still give it a positive review    starship troopers   on the other hand   has a mocking sense of humor   knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem    as a result   starship troopers is a more exciting   energetic   and lively science fiction film    in fact   i probably could never get tired of watching this film    starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars   another kick ass space opera which reinvented the sci fi drama altogether    while starship troopers is no star wars   it comes quite close   and the easiest assessment would be to call this film     the  star wars  of the 90s      am i being to generous to this film    perhaps   but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance   effectively   into the warring races    in essence   this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction    the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films   and i may have to    starship troopers is not quite an original film persay   but director paul verhoeven gives the film a   kick the aliens  asses   style    id4 had this same style   except it was forced   most likely the cause of will smith having a major role    this new   star wars   has a very simple   basic plot   mankind vs   an alien species    the alien species in question here is the bugs   a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid type insects    however   the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy    sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes   but during quiet moments   we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization    more than likely   these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends    and they should be    i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought provoking film    this is an   event   film   but surprisingly above average    it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci fi war film   and actually root for the human side   something independence day never achieved      starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange   join the army   ads    mixing a web based interface   these summations of events are refreshingly original    stating     would you like to know more        these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor   and we know we should not take it seriously    however   we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle   in a gory   yet funny   way    after witnessing the slaughter   the film jumps back one year   to setup what we just saw    we are introduced to johnny rico   casper van dien   and carmen ibanez   denise richards      rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms    however   carmen isn t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot    however   another classmate   dizzy flores   dina meyer     has her eye on rico    unfortunately   rico isn t interested in dizzy    this setup is rather cliched   as is the result of the setup   but it still is fun to watch    carmen signs up to become a starship trooper   and as a result   rico signs up    and as a result   dizzy signs up    everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy   carmen gets the pilot position she wanted   carl jenkins   neil patrick harris     a psychic   gets a position in the training program   and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers   the mobile infantry    the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships    in reality   i found myself watching a space version of   melrose place     but with better special effects    an hour into the film   the war begins    a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with    the first hour may have been a funny   sometimes unintentionally   setup   but we grew to care for the flat characters   because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters   their gorgeous looks won me over   call me superficial   if you must      following the training sessions   which had many dramas in themselves   too many to mention here     the troopers are sent to war    the bugs live on the planet klendathu   a planet which consists of dirt and rock   and pretty much nothing else    many dramas occur during the war   until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs  attacks    a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense    the troopers are ordered to locate the   brain   and capture it    i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible   because starship troopers is not about plot    it s about special effects and gory violence    director verhoeven   most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct   returns to his sci fi days   which gave us good films like total recall    verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa   but despite all the violence   the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood    starship troopers is extremely violent   with more gore than this year s event horizon    the r rating is well deserved   and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it    my guess is that verhoeven s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group    the film has a testosterone level off the charts   with chiseled men and beautiful women    despite these superficial elements   starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful    while watching the film   we never second guess the character s decisions because they seem perfectly clear    thankfully   no hero is punching aliens in the face   which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with    the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with   but they soon grow on you    casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon    to most guys   he will come across as artificial    fortunately   van dien is the worst of the cast   despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character    dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character    her dizzy is extremely likeable    denise richards also does a good job   and her scenes are very well done    jake busey   gary busey s son   gives a wonderfully funny performance   and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film    neil patrick harris   remember   he was doogie howser   is a little wooden   and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast    however   he does give a good performance    michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm    his performance rises above the rest    perhaps it is because his character is the most developed   but i think it is just ironside s presence on screen    unfortunately   no particular cast member gives a star making performance   which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars    director verhoeven is the main star of the film    his direction is fast and unrelentless    he never slows down his pace   which makes for a wild ride    writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein    the writing is usually very funny   and sometimes very corny    the dialogue is smart but not too smart    we aren t required to know everything   but some plot holes are left unanswered    thankfully we are not intended to notice   and we really don t   except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while      amazingly   with all the wars and romance going on   the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues    in fact   these governmental changes seem fairly plausible   and this adds another layer to the story    the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre   but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage    i haven t laughed this loud   even in some comedies    oh   and the special effects are first rate    starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci fi violence and gore   and for some language and nudity    believe me when i say this   don t take young kids to see this film    it is extremely violent    in fact   it is probably the most violent film out this year    however   if you are old enough   over 17   to see it   starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain    it s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros   while also cheering for the bad guys    and still   it is my dream to see a sci fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind   and take over the world    now that would be entertaining    
1437	1	there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor s effort    often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile    when one of these comes along   i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie   that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders    but sometimes there is simply no other explanation   and such is the case with   the hurricane      this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin   hurricane   carter would normally be called   norman jewison s  the hurricane       as per the tradition of referring to a film   belonging   to a director    but though he does decent work   jewison cannot claim ownership of   the hurricane     because there is one reason this film works at all   and his name is denzel washington    washington plays carter   a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late night shooting in a bar    jailed for 20 years   he maintained that he had never committed the crimes   but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals    the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter    through the efforts of that group and carter s lawyers   he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted    the film details carter s childhood   which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop   dan hedaya      when he finally got out of prison for good   carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer   seemingly having his career on track   until the police framed him for multiple homicide    despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities   he remained imprisoned    flash forward to 1983   when lesra   vicellous reon shannon   a young african american boy   living with a group of canadian tutors   reads the book carter wrote while in prison    the book   entitled   the sixteenth round     opens young lesra s eyes to the injustice that was carter s life   and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer    lesra convinces his canadian friends   deborah unger   liev schreiber   john hannah   to work with him towards his goal       the hurricane   leans on denzel washington    he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will   and he does so brilliantly    it s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter   because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be    it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter  a fictional personality invented solely for the film    the actor s work is masterful   washington throws himself into every moment   refusing to keep the audience at arm s length    we feel everything he feels   the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life   the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight   and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost    washington s is a performance of weight and emotional depth    he doesn t merely play angry   happy   or sad   he feels it at the deepest level    his work is masterful   and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor    norman jewison directs the film   doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection       the hurricane   moves quickly   with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely    jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well   the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is   and nothing is terribly confusing    his boxing scenes   constructed with clear inspiration from   raging bull     get inside the action very well   and they are believable as real sports footage    jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick   carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform   and jewison   assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington   shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude   and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell    jewison s best achievement in   the hurricane   is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard knock life   and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again    sadly   though   the film s chief failures lie with the screenplay   as with most of the good but not great efforts to round the pike this winter    there is much to interest a viewer in   the hurricane     but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich   d route possible   it does    take a look at the supporting characters   for example   who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil    carter and lesra   played nicely by shannon   who deserves credit   are the only real people here   everyone else is a stereotype    the canadians are good    the cops are bad    the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey dovey commune   and it is a commune   despite the film s failure to make that clear     while every racist cop   especially dan hedaya s   melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room    much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey     hate put me in prison    love s gonna bust me out         and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made for tv lifetime special    it s too bad    the cast is game   the director does his job   and the subject matter is interesting   but the script takes the safer   slightly more boring route far too often    i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than   he s a racist pig      i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice    in short   i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens    criticism has been levied against the liberties   the hurricane   takes with the truth of what really happened to carter   and much of it is deserved    for example   the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello   only to be screwed by the judges   who ruled giardello the winner    most accounts of the fight   however   have carter losing fairly    furthermore   much of carter s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film   and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained    of course     the hurricane   works mainly as a fable   so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially   but even dismissing such issues don t remove one fact     the hurricane   is a highly flawed film    only one actor could have made a schmaltzy   predictable picture like this work as well as it does   and it s a good thing   the hurricane   has that actor    carter has been quoted as saying     denzel washington is making me look good     but he s not the only one    washington makes this film look good    denzel washington s   the hurricane      sounds pretty good to me

suspects foul play    his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother s hands    hamlet   enlisting the help of his friend horatio   conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery         and  the game is afoot          the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes    with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england   also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers     the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established    interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers    the hamlet castle s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings   mirror panel doors   and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second story loft    costuming is equally grand   drawing upon both history and imagination      not quite the denmark of the 1600 s   the characters  attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia   very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel    it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars   respectively    in addition to directing   kenneth branagh also plays the title character    as the revenge driven royal heir   branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows    from the anticipation of seeing his father s ghost   to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester   to his eventual wrath   branagh delivers in spades    every scene truly revolves around hamlet   as much a tribute to branagh s acting and directing as to shakespeare s manuscript    hamlet seems to be a who s who of shakespearean trained actors   so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself    julie christie   as hamlet s mother gertrude   and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly   as do many of the supporting players    kate winslet as hamlet s lover ophelia   does an outstanding job demonstrating the character s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness    richard briers as ophelia s father   polonius   and michael moloney as her brother   laertes   are equally convincing    nicholas farrell as hamlet s trusted friend horatio   and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast    hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible    in some cases   this made for interesting scenes    billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick   whom hamlet knew quite well    crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian   and the result is a very funny scene    however   charleton heston   whom many might think would butcher shakespeare   is the biggest surprise of all    as the player king   the leader of a troupe of traveling actors   he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba    part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story   with sir john gielgud and judi dench     but this is most unfortunate   for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time    his off camera speaking   while gripping   sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well voiced actor    i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out   and let the venerable actor have the attention    unfortunately   there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions    jack lemmon   an excellent actor   just can t do shakespeare    as marcellus   the guard who sees the elder hamlet s ghost   lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him    gerard depardieu   another talented actor   is wasted when given little more than the utterances of   yes   my lord   and   no   my lord   in the role of reynaldo    richard attenborough has a   literally   walk on role   showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador    i think he had two lines    then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway    when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year   two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was    if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome   well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you    hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one    branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback type images    this only works about half the time   and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them    you don t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare   but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly    the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar   the high school english course    in it   you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king s english    or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes

595	0	back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention   new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big screen update of the cult 1960s sci fi tv show lost in space   complete with in person appearances by cast members mimi rogers   matt leblanc   lacey chabert   jack johnson   and even gary oldman    that should have set off my warning alarms  the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago   when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in person cameo to peddle        last action hero    but no   like millions of others   i bought into the hype and   got lost      if only i had gotten lost  literally  on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped together blockbuster wannabe    you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film    at the convention   goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series   and if that really is the case   i d hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in    to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with  which there most certainly is not    after the setup   in which the robinson family  father john   william hurt   looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews     mother maureen   rogers   wasted     daughters judy   heather graham   ditto   and penny   a heavily made up chabert   looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things     and son will   young newcomer johnson   making the best of it     and pilot don west   leblanc   doing a bad han solo impression   find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr   smith   a watered down but still lively oldman   cashing a paycheck and loving every minute     the script s   stream   of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along  and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting    they encounter another ship    they board it    alien spiders attack them    they return to their ship    the other one explodes    they land on a deserted planet    and so on    an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act   but goldsman doesn t seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device   when one character s past self dies   the future incarnation inexplicably lives on    the look and effects should be lost in space s ace in the hole   but hopkins even manages to botch that    for a big budget film   the visual effects are incredibly shoddy    in one composite background shot   i could see the blue outline around oldman   the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like        digital effects    but nothing in those shots is as jaw droppingly unconvincing as blawp   a monkey like space creature that becomes penny s pet    entirely computer generated and every inch showing it   blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game    apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it   how else can one explain the graininess of blawp s composite shots with the human actors    but in doing so   the seams are that much more obvious    you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal clear solo reaction shot of judy    new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long running star trek cash cow at paramount    i don t think so    in a few years   the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question   what film ended titanic s 15 week reign at the top of the weekend box office

1633	1	what surprises me most about the long awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker    the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis    i can hear batfans everywhere protesting     first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman   and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker        and   indeed   this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play    nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding   oscar worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman    nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown   romero played the joker in the  60s tv series      on one hand   nicholson s joker is extremely funny    his murderous escapades and manic outbursts   which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts   bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film    but on the other hand   his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind    the joker s cruelty and demented   diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister    this guy is off his rocker   and he not only knows it   he flaunts it    but enough about nicholson as the joker   i m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman    like many   i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader    but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting    keaton delivers    he is convincing as the tormented millionaire   bruce wayne   and beneath his hard   black body armor   he is mysterious and formidable as the batman    even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character   keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city    visually   batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team    the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak   gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as   the dark knight returns   and   the killing joke      burton s film is a feast for the eyes   the  35 million budget is definitely on the screen    the sets   costumes   and make up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations    nicholson isn t joking when he boasts     wait  till they get a load of me      his grimacing smile   green hair   and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous    keaton s wardrobe is equally appropriate    batman s cape   mask   and body armor make him look threatening   frightening   and invincible bringing to mind not adam west s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir s outfit in robocop    production designer anton furst s sets are a wonder    gotham city is dark and foreboding   almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york    the batcave is cold   bare   and desolate    the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption    the movie s gritty bladerunner robocop look is a joy to behold    the plot   on the other hand   is not as rousing    the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting    it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear    batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology   but it fails to give us enough of either one    as i mentioned earlier   the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker   but it never fully establishes batman s psychological motives and underpinnings    in terms of action   batman is not as thrilling as you might expect    burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story    more than anything   batman is a mood film    while batman may not completely absorb and excite you   it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books    thanks to its distinctive look   the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world    
1259	1	that s the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into   the wedding singer     the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus    does he draw laughs from his sad   puppy dog expression and don t hate me for being a simpleton observations    or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people    or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over    well   there s a little bit of all of that in   the wedding singer   and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr   sandler s thing   i did have a surprisingly good time    that s because   in a nutshell     the wedding singer   is one of the sweetest movies you re ever likely to come across    that s right    sweet    the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh out loud hysterical but the tone    well   it s just lovely    i have to admit i was half expecting farting armpit humor   gratuitous nudity   superfluous   cloying subplots   and some nasty   unnecessary violence    instead    well   i ve said it before    sweet    the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart   the eponymous wedding singer   a job aspiring rock stars often settle for    when robbie s fianc   e dumps him at his own altar   robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia   drew barrymore   who has some problems of her own   she s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who   unbeknownst to her   isn t that big on monogamy      it isn t giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love    aww        sandler and barrymore are a good match and they re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances   including steve buscemi and jon lovitz   whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film    writer tim herlihy   with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher   keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion    it doesn t all work but it s handled with such light heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans    herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights   sounds   and affectations of the 1980s    the soundtrack  an ever present force in the film  is packed with wall to wall hits of the period   new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol s   white wedding   to the smiths    how soon is now      to culture club s   do you really want to hurt me      the mix of music and fashion would make   the wedding singer   a great double feature with   boogie nights      if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs   then   the wedding singer   is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride    if you re a fan of the lovable   laughable adam sandler   well        let s just say that   the wedding singer   might well be the only film in recent memory to make   me   want to rent   happy gilmore

1695	1	let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal    so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal    i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times    under no circumstances   should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix    this theater   owned by the parent company of one of hollywood s biggest studios   hasn t even graduated into stereo sound yet    the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age    in other words   the sound sucked    as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater   bad sound doesn t do anything to add to a film    i m not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together    there   i ve had my rant   now on with the regularly scheduled review    which sadly won t include commentary on the film s sound which i m assuming was spectacular   but i m just guessing    my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix    it is nothing short of stunning visually    sadly   the rest of the film   while pretty good   doesn t quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good    the matrix has at it s core a good concept   although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked    keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax    it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster    now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator   plugged into a computer network    the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed    the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose    that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons    they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie    reeve s character   neo   is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus   laurence fishburne      newcomer carrie anne moss and one of hollywood s most underrated actors   joe pantoliano   join fishburne in the band of freedom fighters    the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular    this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor s extensive pre production training in martial arts    this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film    when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world   it all adds up to an eyeful    as i already said   the visuals far outpace the rest of the film    acting in the matrix is not bad   but it certainly isn t real good either    keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances    although to his credit   it is one of his better performances    laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci fi action film    more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama    joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had    carrie anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role    it s nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks    you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film    it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences    i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue   which was terrible at times    in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird    it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie    so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about    thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability    my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending    the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before    the ending itself was just plain strange    the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch    while the rest of the film   acting   dialogue and to a degree plot   detract from the high production values   they don t detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening

1278	1	   living out loud     is the type of motion picture we don t often see   it is a film about mature   intelligent adults   instead of the usual american film   in which children basically dress up in grown up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven year olds    judith   holly hunter     a fortysomething living in new york city   has been having a difficult time with life lately    she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband   martin donovan     who had been cheating on her    she cannot sleep   haunted by terrible memories   often imagines off the wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place   and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers   liz bailey   queen latifah     perform at a local club    judith s life does start to brighten a little when   one night when she gets home to her apartment late   strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator   pat   danny devito     a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently    both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other   seeking comfort with the other person   but while pat starts to form a deep love for her   judith only wants to remain friends       living out loud     which was written by richard lagravenese     the bridges of madison county       who is also making his directing debut here   is a wonderful film from beginning to end   one that is honest   genuinely funny   and poignant    the three central characters   that of judith   pat   and liz   are all written to be free thinking   complex human beings   and are all likable   but flawed   people who are constantly interesting   as is the film itself    one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen    sometimes it results in comedy   and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching    one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself   reading a novel    an older woman comes over to her   mentions that that is a great book she is reading   and then goes over to join her own friends    as the woman sits down   she looks over to see judith by herself   and motions for her to come join them    instantly   we realize this was simply in judith s mind   as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends    holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here    hunter   of course   was brilliant in 1993 s   the piano     for which she won an academy award   but in this film she is even better   i think    she finds the right note for each scene and holds it    and devito has never had such a humanistic role before   which i was surprised about    usually he is used as the butt of a joke   or as a caricature   but in this film   has a living and breathing   sympathetic person to play    topping it all off is latifah   also a singer   who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself   and has a juicy   natural supporting role as   in some ways   judith s role model    another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived     happy   ending   but   in staying with its realistic tone   manages to be upbeat   but truthful    the last shot is an especially powerful image    nothing is said   but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all    the relationship that results between judith and pat is true to life and sincere    as we watch these two people talk   and get to know each other   all that we wish for them both is to be happy   even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved    and as     living out loud     which is one of the best films of the year   proves   sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for    
1999	1	glory  starring matthew broderick   denzel washington   and morgan freeman  is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts   the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war    broderick plays robert gould shaw   the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle    shaw   the son of well to do abolitionists   hailed from boston high society    the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard   and were   evidently   the inspiration for glory    as the film begins in 1862   shaw is a captain in the northern forces    like private eriksson   michael j   fox   in casualties of war   shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war  that is   until his company is attacked by enemy forces    shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle   witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck    soon after his recovery   shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort    glory is the story not only of colonel shaw   but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery    the film periodically jumps between shaw s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers    the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits   and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action    the large black cast is uniformly outstanding   especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth    he is brash and pushy   always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight    his bitter   tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability    washington provides much of the film s intensity and emotional power    in one heartbreaking scene   he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army    when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment   you cringe at the sight of his back   which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave    it makes your blood boil    the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings   a tear rolls down washington s cheek  and will probably run down your cheek as well    the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn t deserting the army at all   he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores    freeman is   as usual   a strong presence   even in a small supporting role    he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember    he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers   holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers    colonel shaw recognizes freeman s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major   making him the first black officer in the army    andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles   a free black who is one of shaw s close childhood friends    searles is educated and refined   like a white man   prompting washington to nickname him   snow flake      the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat    the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment    the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships   but somehow they never lose their morale    the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens   subjecting them to racism and discrimination    they are paid only  10 a month   whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen   and   for a long time   they have to go without shoes   guns   or uniforms    to make matters worse   the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action   preferring instead to use them for manual labor    eventually   however   the regiment receives its boots   uniforms   rifles   and right to fight   thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw    shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers   and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve   even if it means threatening a general with blackmail    broderick   in fact   is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment    unfortunately   however   broderick s uneven performance is   in many respects   the weak link in the movie    in an effort to look more mature   broderick sports a mustache and a goatee   and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent    he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced    the film places too much weight on broderick s character and not enough on the black soldiers   who are more intriguing    glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war    the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july    glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts    except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head   the film   for the most part   leaves the gore to your imagination   which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid    to the contrary   they are chaotic and horrifying   it s just that director edward zwick   the co creator of   thirtysomething     films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster    the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers    the movie depicts some of   but not enough of   their customs and rituals    in one scene   for example   the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire    each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration    a couple of the movie s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe   disbelief and pride    the regiment s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle   thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner    like any war film   glory has its share of gloom and despair   but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson   a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say   or   more precisely   what they do not say     blacks played a critically important role in the north s victory over the south  forever changing the evolution of america    
1062	1	after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film   you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again    there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles   as a master would teach an eager apprentice       you caress the noodles with the chopsticks     he says     then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying    see you soon        of course   it s meant to be a parody   but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety    you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat   not something you like   not something you enjoy   but rather something you experience    experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses   fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts    trust me   you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point    juzo itami s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western   set in modern day japan    a stranger   goro   tsutomu yamazaki     comes into town and finds tampopo   nobuko miyamoto     the proprietor of a small   hole in the wall noodle shop   trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman   pisken   rikiya yasuoka      goro   to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles   gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen   emerging bloodied   but victorious    goro finds that tampopo s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away   just to eat a bowl of her ramen    the problem is   her fare is something less than popular   and less than appetizing    however   goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest   and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert   enlist the aid of a wealthy patron   and make friends with the former enemy    this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems    take   for example   when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner    the price is too high   but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum    tampopo meets him at his store late at night   and he leads her to a back room    she protests   thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives   but he insists    just when she is about to bolt for the exit   he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door    she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day   her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience    this scene   while comical   is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation   then of relief and discovery    there s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who   despite their economic trappings   are all gourmets and master sommeliers    we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet    the scene is meant to bring a laugh   but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor   food is something which everyone has in common   and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all    there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film   which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people s lives    a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor    surrounded by her children   she is obviously in her last hours of life    her husband comes home   and seeing her worsened condition   demands that she get up and make dinner    the viewer knows the husband s intention is not to be mean   he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived   and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this    in a near miracle   the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal   then brings it to her awaiting family    as the family eats   she looks on them and smiles    preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her   and for a brief moment   she too enjoys the normalcy    then she falls over   dead    for a moment   the family is stunned   but then the father yells at the children     keep eating    this is the last meal your mother ever made      crying as they do so   the family finishes the meal    the scene is comical   awkward   moving   and beautiful    by including the vignettes   itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film   but surprisingly   they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline    instead   they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble    because the film parodies a western   the construction of the plot is fairly predictable   but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the   good guys   come together for the final showdown    in this case   the showdown is against the ramen    if they eat tampopo s ramen   soup and all   tampopo knows she has succeeded    it s pretty obvious what the outcome will be   but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life   you can afford to cut it a little slack    
1631	1	i ve always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable   death and taxes    oddly   i ve never given much thought to either of the two    maybe if i did   at least i d stop getting collection notices from uncle sam    yes   let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping   hold on to all my receipts   and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake free and will keep me from incurring penalties    it seems that the issue of death may not be so different   at least envisioned here in this film    as this tender love story goes   if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die   you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty    the dreams   wishes   and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true    for those who die with a burdened soul   however   they wind up in that other place    chris and annie   a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra   seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer    their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable    but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie s happiness    and when chris dies after a terrible car accident   she commits suicide   a tortured soul who blames herself    despair is perhaps the greatest sin   and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity    chris   on the other hand   has made it to heaven   and upon learning of annie s fate   he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare    this film brims with imagination   containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell    it seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares    it s shape and look is as infinite as our imagination    as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous   he also begins to learn more about himself    certain questions baffle him at first    why does his home in heaven ooze with paint    what is the significance of the asian stewardess    why does he have an all too willing guide   cuba gooding   jr     to help him find annie    but as he slowly begins to realize the answers   it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie       dreams   is both visually and tellingly beautiful    alas   i have one regret    the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed   but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying    it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish   but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments    however   your eyes will still well up with tears and you ll find lots to savor    the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed    the journey is imaginative    and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film

1102	1	james l   brooks   one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news   returns to the big screen with this entertaining   if slightly flawed comedy    nicholson plays melvin udall   probably the most horrible person ever on the screen    he s racist   homophobic   and never has a good word to say to anyone    so   nobody talks to him   except waitress carol conelly   t   v  sitcom star hunt   who was last seen in twister   1996      naturally   udall   conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop   kinnear   who nicholson hates   all hit it off in the end    like good will hunting   1997   and titanic   1997     even though the outcome is completely obvious   as good as it gets is an enjoyable   funny and warm comedy    nicholson is hilarious as melvin   churning out insults with superb relish    only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers    hunt is also good as waitress carol   and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson    there s also   thankfully   a bit of chemistry between them    kinnear   as the gay neighbor   seems to have a slightly underwritten role   he s more of a plot convience than a character    although his performance is good   his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together    in fact   the scene stealer is simon s dog   who is funnier than nicholson    but then again   pets are always cute on screen    providing solid support is cuba gooding   jnr   jerry maguire   1996   and yeardly smith   who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons   although gooding isn t as good as is character in maguire   he is still fun    he overacts a little   but not so much as to be annoying    smith is also good   although she has a fairly small role    even director lawrence kasdan   body heat   1981   makes an appearance as a doctor    but this is primarily nicholsons film   and every scene he s in   he s steals it    he s character is so hateful   though   it s amazing that anyone talks to him at all   especially carol    and this is the films main problem    it s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin    she doesn t fall in love with him naturally   the film forces her to fall in love with him    also   melvins character seems to go too nice   too quickly    i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice   loving person    it would take a helluva long time   much longer than this film would like to make out    brooks direction is good   though   if a bit average   but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience    he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones   he tends to pile on to much schmaltz   but generally he s good    there s also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer    but   generally   as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do   which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie    the movie is a bit overlong   but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly    overall   as good as it gets is a fun movie   even though it may be unbelivable   and certainly worth seeing   if just for jack nicholsons performance      not quite as good as it gets   pardon the bad joke     but still good fun    
662	0	are you like me    do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places   shouting out loud   not giving a ratt s ass about anyone around them   and basically just wallowing in their own self importance    well if you are   than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half       only to make up and hug in the end    aaaaaaaahhhh        plot   three grown up sisters living their own separate lives   begin to re establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill    critique   this would be a good movie if it wasn t for the fact that it s got very little to say   features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations   is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third rate after school special    and i m being nice    how junk like this gets made is beyond me   but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow   considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit    the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan s character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot    wow       how  deep    of course   the same christmas tune that s played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background   while characters continue to build   bonds   among one another by making reference to old   quaint movies or movie stars    stop me       i m  gonna cry again    this film is a mess    the characters are boring and irritating to watch   the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot   kind of liking their father   but not really   and then finally realizing the error of their ways   while sharing an   emotional   moment about movie stars from the 50s    admittedly   i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes   but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film    meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot   looking as adorable as ever   but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range   cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie tv show that she s in    enough already    and diane keaton must ve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one   cause her acting was amateurish at best    neither one convinced in   emotional   scenes    granted   they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that s probably where my rating of three points comes from    all in all   this movie is not funny   unless you re one to chuckle at train wrecks     provides zero drama   unless you consider loud phone conversations moving     generates absolutely no emotion   although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine   and ends on a perfectly pretentious note     oh no   please don t get any flour on my donna karan dress        ugh    i suggest that all ladies take their husbands boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something    that ll teach  em to mess with you    oh and incidentally   mrs   joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind   so there    then again       maybe  you ll like it

1903	1	the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate    people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future    after a sort of confusing bit involving fake looking cyborg things   the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds    the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while   make that every 1000 years or so   an evil force comes to destroy earth    the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element    the plot in this movie really isn t that important to the thing though    this movie has very good special effects   for the most part    the techno ish music in the background fits the mood very well    bruce willis is an illegal taxi cab driver in a futuristic new york city    one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk    this movie is about what happens    the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations    also there is a fair bit of action in the film   particularly towards the end    some characters are just plain strange including a highly energetic deejay in drag    bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does    the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down    it is one of those sci fi films where you ll be saying   cool   followed by a   what the hell              i give the fifth element    
171	0	maybe this mission should have been scrubbed  mission to mars  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  there s a world of difference between artists and technicians    the artist has a vision to create something new    he may not do it well   it might be sloppy   but it s something you ve never seen before    a good technician can make it look good   but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else   it s going to be just a xerox    obviously successful films need both skills    brian de palma is a masterful technician    he s spent his career copying others   most notably hitchcock    he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work   but only because he has learned it by rote    aside from rare flashes of originality   his films are often soul dead    in de palma s latest   he turns his attention to stanley kubrick    to tell the truth   i enjoyed portions of this movie   but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called   2001      i enjoyed it even more when it was titled   close encounters      nasa has set its sights for mars    when the first crew meets with disaster   a rescue mission is sent to the red planet    they don t do so well either   but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut gone rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe    and it s all so boring    there are so many scenes that just don t work   it s difficult to begin    when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside down martian tornado   which looks remarkably like a sandworm from   dune     destroying everything in its path   they just hang out watching    error    the most interesting character   and that s not saying much   is killed off    error    the alien is laughable    error    the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable    error    there s some nice eyecandy    the face on mars   which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head   looks cool    a three dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world    maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic    but there s so much more that feels as if we ve been there before    from   2001     there s the rotating space station   the blinding white room     from   close encounters     they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens    the list goes on    the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues    even gary sinise and tim robbins can t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing    no one seems to care about anything that happens    you won t either    the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr   pepper   with a 20 foot tall logo   saves the day    they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film    
1166	1	this christmas   little ralphie parker   peter billingsley   wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree    although cautioned by many that he will   shoot his eye out    ralphie remains optimistic   conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers    it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun   and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one     a christmas story  is a favorite among many during the holiday season   and boy   it is certainly easy to see why    ralphie s endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood   when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable    evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things  a christmas story  does so well    here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season    1   period detail    this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard   who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940 s with loving detail    shepard narrates from a first person point of view   divulging his various adventures one snowy december   in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head    shepard s first hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious   but also witty and warm   with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing    on top of that   young billingsley s stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration    director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality    i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like    2   mom and dad    both melinda dillon   as mom   and darren mcgavin   as   the old man    are perfect in their roles    it s hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one   with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured    for instance   he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound   and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues    in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild mannered young lad   peter billingsley has struck quite the chord    his performance is richly textured   making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment    which brings us to          3   the comic situations    there are plenty of memorable moments in  a christmas story     moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing   with so much more to explore and to cherish    i am particularly partial of the   f word scene    in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard    again   shepard s method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry    the numerous sequences that stick in one s mind include   of course   the famous department store santa scene   in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree    i could go on   but i ll finish on this note    a christmas story  is a standout among holiday movies   because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes    not only is it funny   it s often genuinely hilarious         not to mention warm   fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places    i plan on making  a christmas story  a christmas tradition    why don t you    
1026	1	call 911 for the cliche police if you must   but the eyes are the window to the soul    the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze   paul newman   ralph fiennes   anthony hopkins   morgan freeman    you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds   that the characters they play are real human beings    we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor   but he had that unique quality in his eyes    in gridlock d   an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire   shakur and his co star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry    shakur and roth play ezekiel   spoon   whitmore and alexander   stretch   rome   two detroit buddies who share a spoken word jazz trio   an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie   thandie newton      when a new year s eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose   spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time    they soon make a new year s resolution to get into rehab   but that proves to be easier said than done    as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough   spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy   confusion and red tape    the government might be the least of their obstacles   however   as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer   and on the run from a nasty thug   vondie curtis hall      in order for you to buy into gridlock d at all   you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism   unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie   they are going to government offices on new year s day   in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all    gridlock d may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey   1991 s falling down   which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles    in falling down   michael douglas  d fens   the character s personalized license plate   echoed in gridlock d by the drug lord d reper s plates   whips out a gun because he can t get breakfast at mcdonald s   in gridlock d   spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center    and where the unhinged d fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences   writer director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation    one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question     do you expect the world to stop       just  because you picked  today  to clean up      the world in gridlock d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down   but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time    hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system   but perhaps not enough of them    a significant chunk of gridlock d is devoted to spoon and stretch s flight from d reper and from the police   and those sub plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments    in one scene   stretch scares off d reper by getting chummy with a police officer   another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures    the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running   while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time    hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film s main events   perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self destructive behavior    oh   the irony of it    tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case   and living the life to back it up    in gridlock d   shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him    spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall   but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction    mostly it comes through those eyes   eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta    it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch s pure appetite   and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self destructiveness   he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again   which is as much an obstacle to spoon s goal as any agency or enemy    gridlock d s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch   helping   spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife   and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him    with friends like that   spoon doesn t need enemies   and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much    the tragedy now is that we won t get more chances to see those eyes again    
1700	1	a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal    a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation state against another    a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain    a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end    if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy   the violence continues    it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone   even total innocents     anywhere   at anytime that gives the figure his label    edward zwick s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states    you d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines    arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad   and the u   s   responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack    however   unlike the real life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden s camp and manufacturing facility   the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal    in retaliation   the terrorists bring the fight to the new world    unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent in charge anthony hubbard   denzel washington     who works out of the bureau s new york office at one federal plaza    while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple   he encounters cia agent elise kraft   annette bening     also trying to uncover information    generally   the fbi is charged with problems inside the u   s     while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm    even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country    hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory   but as the two form a tentative professional relationship   hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government    the original tagline for patriot games was     there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil      however true   it was pulled before the movie s release because it sounded too much like a dare    revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states   the siege is almost an invitation in itself   because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america    admittedly   the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive   who s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two thirds       but the basic premise is still valid    i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action thriller fare of good guy g men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order    it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab american population   and that in an effort to find the terrorists   the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself    in fact   about halfway through the film   when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city   the liberties of all americans are put at risk    although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign   the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups    throughout   the film maintains a conflict between hubbard   who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law   and general devereaux   bruce willis     who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully    what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act   utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides    it actually gets rather heady at times   but it s a credit to screenwriters zwick   lawrence wright   and menno meyjes that they don t underestimate the intelligence of the audience    i don t know if it s his tone or inflection or something else   but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great    this   combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid level authority figure   makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable    annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i ve seen recently   and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable    it s somewhat unfortunate that her character s fortitude is broken at a certain point   but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range    bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough guy role   always standing straight   and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face    however   the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film s development    notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad   a lebanese immigrant    the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage   and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society    difficult to say the least   shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch    perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom   wings     shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night    whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick s favorite actor   he directed washington in glory and courage under fire     james horner seems to be his favorite composer    i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score writer graeme revell   seven films this year already   over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian themed music   and horner s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish sounding at most    revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole    it s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we ve been getting throughout the year    missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes    for example   it s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick    unfortunately   there s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions   obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye catching    in the middle of the city   and against no real opposition     zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops    verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point    the film also gets a little preachy toward the end   focusing on the ability of different races to get along    a noble gesture   the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously    these flaws are glaring   but they don t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class    
1906	1	well i ll be damned        the canadians can make a good movie    the world is coming to an end    we don t know why or how   but apparently there is no way to stop it    the world has had this information for months   as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations    yet for a handful of toronto citizens   life goes on    they aren t going crazy or attacking people in the streets    instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end        some engaging in activities they ve always wanted to do   some gathering with family and friends   and others just seeking to be alone    these people s lives however all intersect during their final six hours    writer director star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film    all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth    craig   callum keith rennie   tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies   a gas company employee   david cronenberg   calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business   and patrick   mckellar   just wants to be by himself but isn t having much success    even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to   tying everyone even closer    things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film   but ultimately everything comes together nicely   although it s not a happy film        some moments are understandably gut wrenching      the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances   particularly from sandra oh   whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end    i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given   nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight   in toronto anyway      but i do wonder why the sun never sets    come midnight   the sun is still shining brightly    maybe the sun is crashing into the earth        who knows    also   it s comforting to know that in mankind s final moments on the planet   people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus   that s not a shot at this film mind you        i know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars      last night is available on dvd from universal home video    it contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer     r   
1032	1	linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction   and her being cast as dogma s lead is nothing short of inexplicable    she s still in fine form as bethany   an abortion clinic worker who s lost her faith    one night   a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany s bedroom    he is metatron   alan rickman     the voice of god   and he needs her help   she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church the fate of the universe depends on it    god would do it him herself   but he she is       missing   having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again    bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the   prophets   jay   jason mewes   and silent bob   kevin smith   doing double duty     the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith s films thus far    at some point   rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus   the undocumented   and very black     thirteenth apostle     and offers his assistance   as does divine stripper serendipity   salma hayek      it s a wild ride    they re in pursuit of loki and bartleby   damon and affleck   respectively this is probably the sharpest either has ever been     who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return    loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates    at one point   he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets    it s a nasty   guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks     how corrupt are you        wings of desire this ain t    since debuting with clerks   smith has grown as a director   particularly in terms of working with actors       chris rock is this film s only weak link between jokes   he s wooden      his no frills visual style hasn t changed much over the years   though   dogma s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations     nor has his writing his characters still sit around delivering one caustic   hilarious speech after another    dogma chips away at big religious issues namely   the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs eloquently and articulately   but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition    as well   the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever    any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum   hurlyburly   anyone       and eventually dogma s pacing goes slack    a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game   in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings   comes at a point when we ve heard enough    because his change of heart   bartleby is initially the good cop to loki s bad   drives the climax   said rant is given a great deal of screen time    sure   affleck deserved a big moment   damon steals their scenes together prior     but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated    like tarantino   smith was a video age sponge who became a sample mad indie filmmaker    dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies   including indiana jones and the last crusade   with silent bob doing his best harrison ford   and weird science a shit demon attacks our heroes    smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour   his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical   a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan   catholicism wow       and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished    i bust   ed     a gut on several occasions    proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever    it s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease   for to read it   one actually has to see dogma    the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ s   martin scorsese s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis  controversial novel   in that it is not directly linked to the picture s content but to rumours and heresy    there s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime   just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against       not one of them had watched it      every single person refused    smith and scorsese have a lot in common   and so do the two films in question   because both smith s bethany and scorsese s jesus are hollow shells without their faith    in fact   dogma s denouement   which follows a thrilling showdown that s worth the wait   is a catholic love in   a veritable recruitment poster       i felt sentimental about a religion i don t belong to    now that s powerful filmmaking     smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god   and that spirituality shines through    it s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins    my religion is movies    when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine   in a roundabout way they re attacking what i live for   freedom of expression through celluloid    i therefore feel that   although i m no bible thumper   i m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers    
951	0	 bats  is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan    to pull something like this off   you need to have a sense of wit and style   with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines    something like the underground worm thriller  tremors  had just the perfect mixture of these elements   and in return   the film was tremendous fun    with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player    bats  mainly plays it s premise for straight arrow horror    judging by the ridiculous premise   this was not exactly a wise move    the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock s  the birds    but fails miserably    done right   it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema    unfortunately    bats  is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly   terribly wrong    the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be    i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom  bats  is aimed toward    those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats    these bats are not very nice   because they eat a lot of people    boy   are these bats ugly    they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super duper smart    they ve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all    a whole bunch of people in texas get killed   so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats    they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with   but the bats are pretty smart   so it s sorta hard to do    the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good    but no    bats  is probably too violent for pre schoolers    the film   directed by louis morneau   should have ventured straight into video stores    on the small screen   perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations    but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward   although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure   the film is poorly written   poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude    even the bats themselves are cheesy   and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed    the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey   lou diamond phillips     who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small town authority figure usually portrays   he chomps on a cigar   struts contentedly in his boots   etc            the scientist is dr   sheila casper   dina meyer     who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as  the best in her field     meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable   but everything about dr   casper is recycled beyond recognition    her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper s tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in  jaws     everything revolving around  bats  is tired drivel   which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up    the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw   with voices dubbed in later    in fact   that may have worked out better in the end    take one glance at casper s bat loathing sidekick jimmy   leon     and you ll have immediate deja vu   he s the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie   constructed specifically for timed comic relief    unfortunately   none of his comic interludes are funny    in the role of deranged mad scientist dr   mccabe   the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch    mccabe  accidentally  released two experimental test subjects   and the virus spread to other bats    the entire town of gallup   texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures   but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else    something like    when is the damn movie going to be over      i just want my money      the bats are ugly   i must say    there s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing   but mainly   the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery    only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been   but by the absurdly stupid climax   it s way too late in the game for a decent recovery    characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire    let s explore the logic there   is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population      you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one   and after that there are only 18   000 more of them    this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind  bats     
60	0	of course i knew this going in    why is it that whenever a tv star makes a movie it s always a romantic comedy   and then they say on entertainment tonight or something   that they were   attracted to the characters    they were really original      original     let me give you a run through of picture perfect   character a   kate   jennifer aniston   from tv s friends     a smart   beautiful   professional woman wants two things she can t have   a new job title and the love of her co worker kevin bacon    her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar   and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls    what does she do    she invents a fiance    then when everyone wants to meet him   she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him  1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner   and pick a fight with her at the end   thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job   since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor   defenceless female    he   of course   goes along with it    gee   i wonder if they get together in the end    i ve seen more original stuff on the wb    and better stuff too    picture perfect also makes the mistake of being  wayyyyy  too long at 100 minutes   and expecting us to like aniston s character   who comes off as a cold   spoiled bitch    
742	0	in this year s summer movie preview issue of  entertainment weekly    theresa connelly described her writing directing debut    polish wedding    as   a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would      one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film   a comedy drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements    the family at the center of  polish wedding  is the pzoniaks   which consists of mother jadzia   lena olin     father bolek   gabriel byrne     sole daughter hala   claire danes   and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness    it s a large family   but there s not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch   certainly not in the primary trio    jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family   but she s kind of a hypocrite since she s carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija      her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek   who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration    also   how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy   sexy jadzia    hala is a spoiled   self centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy    with such an unappealing set of characters   it s no surprise that  polish wedding  s plot complications are far from involving    naturally   jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop   russell schuster   adam trese     who fathered the child   but he refuses to make such a commitment    ho hum    another complication   involving the decidedly un virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary   is first played for laughs and then   inexplicably   as a profound statement in the film s climax  which   ironically   is funnier than any of the film s lame attempts at humor   such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell    that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly    the jadzia bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers    the hala russell conflict isn t resolved in as contrived a manner   but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something    and then there s some atrocious dialogue   which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound     look at all these pickles    just looking at them gives me such great sadness      as misguided as  polish wedding  is   the affair is something of a letdown   considering the strong performances by byrne   danes   and especially the fiery olin    they obviously believed in connelly and her material  a faith that audiences will be hard pressed to share    
584	0	the year is barely a week old   and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997  the relic   a would be chiller that s more successful at making the audience laugh than scream    in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams   whose last two pictures were dreadful jean claude van damme vehicles     a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses   hypothalamii     of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum    how did this creature come into existence   and why does it feed on hormones    the   scientific   explanation cooked up by the four  yes   four  credited screenwriters   amy holden jones   john raffo   rick jaffa   and amanda silver   takes   suspension of disbelief   to new heights   even by monster movie standards    but as cockamamie as the science is in the film   it isn t quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics    miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination   turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip   complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears    give it up   penelope  it s a  monster movie     on the flip side   tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant   but his role is so thankless that it s hard to imagine it being played any more effectively    it s quite funny to see a film indulge   with the straightest of faces   in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well   and so recently   in scream    for example   in one early scene   a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night    ok   we all know what s coming   but as if we didn t need any more confirmation   he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away    everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie    and later   miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing    does she make a beeline for the front door    of course not  she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall    with all the cliches   it is only fitting the film s climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film   that of someone outrunning a fireball    if the relic is truly   the next evolution in terror   as the poster states   then the horror film  and humanity  is in even worse shape than we thought    
68	0	mr   nice guy is the latest jackie chan film   so you should know what to expect    a weak plot   terrible dialogue   very little acting ability   but some jaw dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile    however   mr   nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie s best efforts   and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever    jackie chan plays   who else   jackie    this time out   he s a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show    not that it ever makes a difference in the plot    there are only two scenes of him cooking    for the rest of the film   somehow he mutates into jackie chan   supercop    it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills       perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege    a tv newswoman   diana   gabrielle fitzpatrick     covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo   richard norton   and a local gang of toughs   the demons    although she only has one camcorder   somehow the result is full of close ups and multiple angles       hmmm    shades of broadcast news        anyway   the goons discover diana   and will do anything to recover the tape    here lies another crucial flaw in the story   doesn t anyone realize you can copy a tape    oh well   no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense    as luck would have it   diana runs across jackie   and   wouldn t you know it   jackie accidentally ends up with the tape    this leads to countless chase and or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie    in a move apparently designed to woo american   and other english speaking   audiences   the film uses english as its primary language    however   that doesn t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie s recent americanized releases    strangely   many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english   and poorly too    whether this is just a very bad case of looping   an effort to minimize accents   or a simple case of nostalgia   it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie s dubbed films    the plot in mr   nice guy is negligible   merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons    but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie s films   it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread    look   if you have jackie chan playing a chef   why not use that to your advantage    watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen   beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts    the action is a mixed bag here    there s really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie s films    it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site   apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan    the action in the film is neither jackie s best nor worst   but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes    the film s gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting    once or twice   it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence    but to slo mo jackie running    either this is a nod to the six million dollar man   or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down    if you ve seen all of jackie s films and are in need of another fix   go ahead and see mr   nice guy    however   if you re just in the mood for some good action   you d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work   such as supercop

1183	1	i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater   on a sunday afternoon    when the movie was over and the audience was exiting   i didn t hear one negative comment   and i didn t have any to offer    simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys   simon   ian michael smith   and joe   joseph mazzello     and what destiny holds for both of them    simon is a dwarf   who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart    surprisingly   he does   and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle    simon thinks god has a plan for him   a purpose for his life   and his condition   he just doesn t know what    joe is an illegitimate child   referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard     who s mom   ashley judd   won t tell him who his father is    simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem   the people in the town don t really like him   because he isn t   natural      even his own parents don t care about him   and are disappointed they didn t have a   normal   son    he is also harassed in church by the local pastor   rev   russell   david strathairn   and simon s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks    the only person   other than joe   that really cares for simon is joe s mom   who he also looks up to as a mother    it would be just simon s luck   that he would accidentally kills joe s mom   something you are told at the beginning of the movie    joe   now motherless as well as fatherless   feels the need to find out who his real father is    with the help of ben   oliver platt     the local drama teacher and joe s mom s current boyfriend   before her death     he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way    most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny   although not all of it is    simon will also look for god s plan for him   although he loses a little faith along the way    starring in the first   and last   five minutes of the film is hollywood s newest dramatic actor   jim carrey    jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off   and then tying it up just right    this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway   and he does a commendable job    simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson   this is his first film as director   but he has written several films   including the grumpy old men series    he does an outstanding writing and directing job here   the film s structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly    the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat    the cast is excellent    joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance    joseph is outstanding for someone of any age   not alone someone who just turned 15    ian michael smith   in his film debut   has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation    other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast    i loved this movie   it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year    take your whole family to see simon birch   it is a magnificent film  an american masterpiece    
1839	1	in chocolat   a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures   patterns   and lines   hoping she ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they ll most enjoy    some scoff the idea   but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next   revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before    this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole   on the surface   it appears to be a light   fluffy fable with no depth or true worth   but when one takes a second   deeper look   chocolat s true colors begin to shine through    making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it   lasse hallstrom s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted not to mention one of the best films of the year    what gives chocolat its magic   much like hallstrom s 1999 winner of two academy awards   the cider house rules   is its willingness to say what s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences    the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers   but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow mindedness    chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet   where majority rules   and the majority lives by only one law   religion    the bulk of the townspeople   with few exceptions   are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence   lent   but when the independent thinking   seemingly non religious vianne rocher   juliette binoche   and her daughter anouk   victoire thivisol   make the village their home   the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens    many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent   especially the mayor   comte de reynaud   a cartoon like alfred molina     who will stop at nothing to put her out of business    on the other hand   the shop is a delight to others   including the cranky armande voizin   judi dench     who sits day by day in vianne s shop   telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson   aurelien parent koening     which comes as a result of his mother   carrie ann moss   believing armande is a bad influence   as she does not hold the same   strict religious beliefs that she does    also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat   whose husband is constantly beating her   to whom vianne offers a home and befriends    juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne   genuinely capturing her character s determination to turn the narrow minded townspeople into more happy   independent human beings   but most of chocolat s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses    lena olin   previously nominated for an oscar in 1989   deserves her second nomination for her earnest   moving portrayal of a lost   scared woman torn between staying true to her battering   manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs    judi dench is sharp   incisive   and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin    carrie ann moss   in what is likely to be her first largely noticed   and acclaimed   role since the matrix   shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen   crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously    victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk   a young girl hoping her always on the move mother will eventually settle down    a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline     five extraordinary women   one extraordinary movie      that s not to say the men don t do their share   though   alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist   hugh o conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is   and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux   who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne    the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board   lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care   perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film    cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric   fairy tale look to the film   and rachel portman s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules    chocolat   adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel   is a wonderful little treat of a film   one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter   and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter    while not as powerful as the cider house rules   lasse hallstrom s chocolat is a film which works on all levels as a drama   a comedy   a fable   a romance   and a fairy tale    and it even lives up to its name   it is delicious to savor the taste of   easy to digest   and   like all

562	0	i love movies    i really do    every time i watch great movies like goodfellas   1990   or raiders of the lost ark   1981     a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent   skill and entertainment that is on display    even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1 3   1994   or ghostbusters ii   1988   while not exactly brilliantly well made   are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value    then there s my favourite martian   the exact opposite of what a movie should be   a hurried   poorly written and acted movie with one goal   to make money    disney   ever since the lion king   1994   have lost their magic touch   but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk    christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t   v reporter s tim o hara car   daniels     and soon tim finds the martian in his home   trying to recover and fix his spaceship    along with his  zoot  spacesuit   voiced by wayne knight   must fix his spaceship before it explodes   and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public   firstly by o hara   but later by rival t   v presenter brace channing   hurley     by calling himself tim s  uncle martin       laughter  is supposed to arise from the  comical  events   but never does    many bad films have good intentions   but my favourite martian doesn t appear to try to provide any entertainment    filled to the brim with wham bang special effects   my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy    christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie   i ve never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now    jeff daniels plays  staple nice guy  and his role is useless    his performance is incredibly lazy   although his paperthin character doesn t deserve more than the performance he gives    darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever   but her role is somewhat   erm   limited    hurley mistakes  acting  for  shouting and looking like a twit  and wins the david wilcock award for  most irritating   godawful performance in a moving picture      way to go liz    for the supporting cast   disney manage to assemble every character actor out there   during the film i was going  he was the guy in       ah     er          before finally giving up and switching off    another major setback is the staple  comedy sidekick      unfortunately   the writers   sherri stoner and deanna oliver   if anyone cares   forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be  funny      instead   they deliver zoot   the martians deeply unfunny sidekick    although meant to be a manic character no doubt   every line that comes out of his  neck  is a dud    a real dud    citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester    even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character   not one child even bothered to smirk    it s a nice special effect   though    another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves    or rather   the lack of them    my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour   it goes past the bowl   down the pipe and into the sewer    now   toilet humour can be funny   as dumb and dumber   1994   humorously showed    but here   characters farting   belching and almost getting crapped on   literally   is not  amusing      it s insulting    there s one good gag right before the credits   but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued    either that   or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn t mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes    yes   men at work    yowza    the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film   and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more    there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can t get distribution   yet trash like this gets released nation wide with ease    thankfully   as soon as it makes it s money   it will never be seen again   and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie   down the toilet    
1448	1	   desperate measures   was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released   summer  97    for some reason   it was delayed until hollywood s traditional dumping ground   january    now that it s out   i see no real reason for that delay   as it s a simple yet highly entertaining film    michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective   garcia      keaton agrees to the transplant   only so he can attempt escape    he succeeds   in a plan that of course could only work in the movies    the police force is now trying to kill keaton   while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son    the film definately has it s flaws    the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare   but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status    also   after keaton s escape   garcia s captain barks at him   how many men have to die to save your kid s life      which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark    the thing is   it s a vaild point    how many people have to be needlessly crippled   burned   and killed just to save this one child    what s the greater good here    many lives or one life    if movies really had guts nowadays   i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia s character    place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else    alas   movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable    despite a few silly moments   and one or two really stupid ones     the good things about   desperate measures   outnumber the bad    the main highlight would be keaton s performance    the character could have easily been an overacting   scene chewing freak   but keaton underplays it nicely    he s not as menacing as he was in   pacific heights   or even as menacing as he was in   batman     yes kids   batman used to be a dark character     but you certainly get the idea that he s evil    even the final scene of the film   which normally i would just hate   seems strangely appropriate for this film    so much so that i didn t mind it in the slightest    and another bonus   the film takes place in san francisco   which usually means a car chase on those hills that you ve seen a billion times before    and for a moment   it looked as though it was about to happen    but it doesn t   and that s creative     r   
1810	1	did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion    that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward   with a comatose sunny von bulow    she is the main narrator of the film   in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder    the dramatic trick works   as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder   sex   unhappiness   and a lawyer s moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win    jeremy irons is claus von bulow   in what is his finest role   and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history    he is as hated as any man alive   as cold as a cucumber    his remorse for his wife s comatose condition is nonexistant   and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas   1980    the background to the case is such    during christmas of 1979   sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke    the same situation occured in 1980   only sunny never woke   and probably never will    when examined   it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood    claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson   convicted   and freed on bail    he immediately hires alan dershowitz   the renowed harvard law professor   to acquit him    ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him    we follow him through two very different cases   the case of the johnson case   where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn t commit   and von bulow   who he still hasn t figured out    dershowitz doesn t know what happened to sunny   and he is extremely hesitant to take the case    nevertheless   he does   based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him    together with a group of law students   dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed    silver s performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film    schroeder directs on many different levels   with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz    there are flaws   at times   the film gets overly theatrical    yet   due to glenn close s troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow   the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well    the flashbacks are good   but at times schroeder doesn t fill in the blanks    the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film   and it could have used a better ending    the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly   without any intelligent conclusion    the supporting characters are often neglected   and dershowitz s team should have been allowed to grow character wise   but schroeder over simplifies the story and the characters    yet   for all these flaws   the film is deeply engrossing because of irons    as von bulow   he is brutally evil    anti semitic   prejudiced   arrogant   protective   he is a rotten   lying monster   whose conviction may have been wrong legally   but morally he was to blame    irons plays him to a cold perfection   with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence    he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder    however   the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility    there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife s death by years of neglect and coldness    however   legally   did he do the murder    schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind    with all the character flaws   reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent   he wants the viewer to make up his own mind    schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations   and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow   in death    for all the failed dramatic theatrics   this is one that works beautifully    we don t know what happened    that sense of legal ambiguousness   along with von bulow s obvious moral guilt   is why reversalf fortune works    in the end   von bulow is as sadistic as ever    irons is haunting   and that is why reversal of fortune is so good

270	0	as you should know   this summer has been less than memorable    with a total of 4 decent films   it s not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing    with that said   you can pretty much predict what my opinion on   the 13th warrior   will be    the film is based on the michael crichton   eaters of the dead     in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king    after tarveling for many months   he comes across a gang of norsemen   who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog    so   they start picking men   and are left without 1   thus ahmed is choosen    so far it sounds interesting right    not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes    after that   they basically run around killing    that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film   because once your story is introduced   you have the rest of the film to start developing it    obviously that s not the case here    even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure   you will be disappointed    since all the action takes place in fog   it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances   and to poor camera work    can t the camera men sit still    i d like to actually watch a film in focus   but again   they failed to deliver that as well    the film moves on and on until the point   where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you re eating    with corny dialogue   that the characters laugh at for some odd reason   a script that goes nowhere   dull action sequences   a predictable ending   and worst of all weak characters   there s basically nothing to like here   except for maybe the set designs    that s the only thing that honestly caught my interest    when i heard that john mctiernan   the director   wanted his name kept out of the project   that made me wonder why    well now i know    crichton s greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product   which led to a big arguement    what s there to argue about anyway    the film couldn t be saved   no matter how much they spent or casted    seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money   i wouldn t be surprised to see   the 13th warrior   become a hit    please do me a favor and save your money at all costs   or else you will be lost in the fog   like the film itself    
707	0	i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been    mind you   though   i mean this in the worst possible way    i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream s    as a result   it s even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures   see nightmare on elm street   because it thinks it s about thirty times smarter than it is    based on a teen book of the same name and   disappointingly   adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson   i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top    the appropriate mood being set   this is angst horror for the 90 s     we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town    from there   we see the blond   female protagonist   helen shivers   woodenly played by sarah michelle geller     getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male   hero     barry cox   woodenly played by ryan phillipe     and matched brunette pair of protagonists   julie james and ray bronson   woodenly played by party of five s jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr     respectively   cheer her on    after getting drunk at a party   going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing   and having some meaningful sex   if you believe what the characters say     the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night    his face is mangled so they can t tell who it is   and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world    cut to one year later    the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad    main brunette female   the bright one of the bunch   has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college    blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light   and now works at the family store in town    brunette male is a fisherman   living off the land    blond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team    then   predictably   their past comes back to haunt them    it all begins with an irrational murder   followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer   bad acting by a good actress   anne heche     an improbable plot   bad acting by the main bad actors   some more killing   concluding in a climactic scene   mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie    all the while   the actors and actresses spout off bad lines   and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation    not that the movie was without pleasure    count the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun    mostly   though   note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye catching pair look    
1697	1	who would have thought    jim carrey does drama    when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show   i thought     what a hilarious idea for a movie      however   it was an even better premise for a drama    the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man    that man is truman burbank   jim carrey      truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly   cristof wants to keep it that way    christof is the   god   of this made up world    he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles    there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world   but they failed and life went on as normal    the opening parts of the film introduce to truman s world    we see what he is doing at his current age   then we get a flashback at his past    it may seem a tad boring   but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start    the film can be described in one word   weird    it seems like such a simple idea   yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of   but andrew niccol did    it seems like a warped idea   but it is andrew s idea and he did wonders with it    jim carrey actually lived up to the hype    the hype   whether good or bad   always focused on carrey s ability to do drama    no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be   the only thing they doubted was carrey    and he showed them all up    jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars    i do not think he was the best actor   but he deserved the nomination    he plays truman burbank   the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world    he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years   but then strange things start happening    he ventures into the wrong elevator    a light crashes in front of him    his father comes back and is then pulled away    we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show   but truman does not    and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish    carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama    laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife    she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point    peter weir does not make the cast perfect   and their flaws eventually lead to truman s escape    the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down    despite carrey s greatness   the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris   who plays the   god   of truman s world    he displays the pressure he is under   the world he has created    he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life    the action moves at a good pace   and rarely gets sluggish    but   the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show    it really makes you think    maybe your brother is an actor   maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show    some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking    or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman s arrival    and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon   noah emmerich   delivers his dramatic line    all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative    i was not only enjoying the film   i was overwhelmed by genius of it    overall   the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood    jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces   but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best    andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection    the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film    
1330	1	do film critics have morals    are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow    naturally we don t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions   which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish    secondly   and along the same line   we can t prejudge a film because of it s stars   director   etc   the difference    well   in the first one   we d go into a film thinking it s going to be dumb or it s going to be good   and that would affect our viewing   that movie sounds and looks dumb   so i m not expecting much      on the second hand   we re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal   grudge   against the film company   it s made by disney    oh   it s just a merchandising ploy then     the actors   jim carrey s in it    it s gonna stink       or the director   who    can t be that good      this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint    make sense    ok   but what about comparing    isn t that kind of along the same lines    when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer s credibility in one film to another they were involved in   is that really fair    sure   in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more   but what about jackie brown   for example    is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction   just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both    i think it is   and i ll tell you why    a good critic should be able to view the film from the   average joe   or jane     viewpoint   while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film    sometimes that can be tough       the acting was superb   but i was bored   or   i loved it      it was sooooo cheezy      might be used to describe a film    these are contradictions   and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique    but which is more important    and which is better    an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring   or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again    getting back to the point   my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway    every average person out there who s interested in this film is likely to ask   how does it compare to pulp fiction      and so   as a critic   i m already responsible to ask that same question    jackie brown stars pam grier   the   blaxploitation   heroine from the 1970 s   who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character    tarantino s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta s sudden revival in the movie industry   and with talks of an oscar nomination   the same is likely to happen for grier       we ve made it thru comparison  1     jackie is a 44 year old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash   and probably her main revenue   by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie   pulp fiction s samuel l   jackson and comparison  2      ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara   robert de niro     a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years   to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half  million dollars    trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet   michael keaton   and taken into custody for possession of narcotics   as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed    naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell s plans and   not as friendly intended as we d hope   he posts jackie s bail after she is put behind bars    the thing is   ordell is in this for no one more than himself   and as we learn from his previous actions   he s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way    jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze    ordell won t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she s always done   yet at the same time   a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided    it comes down to a simple question   would jackie rather face ordell or prison    what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help   the law   ordell   or maybe just herself    coming into play is another 70 s veteran   robert forster as jackie s bail bondsmen max cherry    max s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system   and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance    also involved is ordell s   surfer girl   girlfriend melanie   bridget fonda     a ditzy sun  bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand    fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role   but there s nothing more to her   and therefore   she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters    de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself    de niro is a brilliant actor   but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn t need a de niro to play him    compared to pulp fiction   comparison  3     the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable    in pulp fiction   even the small   seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful   complete   and lifelike   whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast   the exception being grier    tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind   so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth    sadly   grier too could have received a bit more attention   especially when the story is all about her newly jarred perception of life    jackson teams up with tarantino again   but the chemical reaction isn t as awesome as the first time    jules was the rambling   bible quoting hitman in pulp fiction   and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off    and although jackson is really   really good in jackie brown   i don t think he s quite as irreplaceable    in fact   maybe a new face would have been better    jackson could ve remained tarantino s jules   and a new guy could have become ordell   forever to remain so in our memories    sadly   these characters are too much the same   except ordell just isn t as impressive   and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules    another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning    this is grier s film   so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses    it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted   but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story    it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style   and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard s novel   rum punch      for those movie goers   don t expect another pulp fiction and you ll be satisfied   for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90 s film  making    the directing has toned down a bit   however   yet we re still reminded that this is tarantino s movie thanks to odd split screen story telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints    so getting back to the question that i began with   this isn t pulp fiction at all    it s good   but it isn t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place    this is a more conservative tarantino   but not one that won t satiate true fans    if you can realize that this isn t going to knock your socks off   then you ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet    after all   we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy    
53	0	talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters    spice world is the feature film debut of the pre fabricated pop band   the spice girls    it s intended as a sort of hard day s night   but ends up simply hard to watch    when watching the spice girls   i m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick   such as from the smurfs   the snorks   or teenage mutant ninja turtles   in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name    the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles   and about as talented    there s ginger   geri halliwell     the brainy one   sporty   melanie chisholm     the athletic one   baby   emma bunton     the childish one   posh   victoria adams     the fashion conscious one   and scary   melanie brown     the one with a tongue pierced back so far you re almost certain the post sticks out her throat    the film itself doesn t really have a plot    it follows the girls as they travel here and there   culminating at their   first live performance   at albert hall    the action   however   seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas    the various misfires include   an alien encounter   a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls   the shooting of a spice girls documentary   a movie producer   george wendt   trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie   nearly all of which   though incredibly far fetched   seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up     a meeting with a pregnant friend   whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends     a boating adventure   a bus race   club hopping   wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd       even  when they start to sing     and an assorted number of musical performances   press conferences   and general all around celebrity stuff    whew    for some reason   the film is littered with star cameos    from elton john to elvis costello   from bob hoskins to meat loaf    heck   even roger moore shows up   though he can t decide if he s parodying himself as james bond   or if he s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld    richard e   grant has the largest secondary part   a thankless role of the band s manager   clifford    the celebrity spotting is partially amusing   and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film    neither amusing or spontaneous   when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring    their songs are alright   but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos    my advice to fans is   stay home and watch that video collection   or at least spin that cd a couple of more times       either  option will be more enjoyable than the film    non fans should know to stay well away from this one

297	0	when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions   i turned to my friend and said     dangerous liaisons for kids      it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense   owing everything it is to stephen frears  1988 masterpiece    imagine my surprise to see that writer director roger kumble has given credit to his source material   choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits    and i was impressed    in fact   i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film   which is an appalling excuse for a movie    it s kiddie porn hackwork   complete with earthy sex talk and fully clothed hand jobs    i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable   with all the teen high school angst movies coming out   there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they re smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined    cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way   and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to   i hated all the characters   and i hate everything they do    i also hate ryan phillippe   so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be    phillippe plays   check out this name   sebastian valmont    wow    isn t that a memorable name    i could just say it over and over again    sebastian valmont    it kind of rolls off the tongue   in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich    sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth   there is no woman he can t have   no material object out of his reach    he has all the money   all the sex    all at his fingertips    and   luckily   his parents never enter into his life    no   in the world of cruel intentions   adults don t really exist    the ones who do are irritating    sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister   kathryn merteuil   sarah michelle gellar     the bitch queen of the universe   and also the woman every man wants    since these two rich kids are so bored   they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons    kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de virginize cecile caldwell   selma blair     a naive dork chick who has somehow wronged kathryn    but it s too easy for sebastian valmont    he wants to nail annette hargrove   reese witherspoon     the   paradigm of chastity and beauty      so   sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal   which is too explicit to state here      but    dear god       sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove    dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable   and because of its masterful acting    cruel intentions is bad for many reasons   but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting    kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch   a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her    she is supposed to be mean   but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons    gellar   while aesthetically pleasing   is one dimensional and utterly repulsive    witherspoon has a truly beautiful face   but her character isn t the moral staple she s supposed to be   sure   she won t have sex until she s in love   is this really a   moral   issue       but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible    but i can t forget mr   phillippe   who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable   invulnerable blandness    i have to give him credit and say that he did   in fact   manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions    and there s one point in the film in which he shouts   thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone    true   he is bad   but it doesn t help that he has no character to work with    kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character   leaving us with a sex crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch    the film fails in every other way   too    first of all   nobody talks like this    even the   intellectuals   i know don t bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering    for a while   the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs   but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there s no way we can join it    cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft porn in more than one scene    earlier i mentioned a fully clothed hand job   this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont   both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie    so   if we hate them   then what s the point of an extended sex scene    titillation   of course    it can t even work under the pretense of   meaningful love scene     because we hate the characters    it s interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons    kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film   many of the scenes have a similar tone   and there are moments in frears  film that kumble imitates almost completely   such as the last scene   in which  spoiler warning     the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers      but kids don t act like this    nobody acts like this    in his translation   roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy    some pretty crucial elements    the result is a picture of confounding badness   a kiddie porn mess that thinks it s really deep and profound    i ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences   but that doesn t change the fact that it s awful

970	0	while watching loser   it occurred to me that amy heckerling s true genius as a film maker is casting    in fast times at ridgemont high   she gave us sean penn s jeff spicoli   in look who s talking   she turned bruce willis into a wise cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival   in clueless   she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is   or was   alicia silverstone    she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws    unfortunately   she may also be starting to understand that she understands    giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies    giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal  is  the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser    naturally   heckerling makes her protagonist an all around swell guy    paul tannek   jason biggs   is a small town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu   then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold hearted big city    paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman   his roommates adam   zak orth     chris   tom sadoski   and noah   jimmi simpson   are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul    paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar   in this case the lovely dora diamond   mena suvari      dora has problems of her own   including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor   edward alcott   greg kinnear     that s more than slightly one sided    they re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people   so clearly they belong together   even if paul is a loser    i must confess that   for a while   i was suckered in by heckerling s casting    jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace   suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence    they re pleasant enough to watch   and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren t    then it gradually becomes clear that there s virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort    in theory   loser is a romantic comedy   but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film   notable exception   a cameo by a scene stealing comic actor as a video store clerk      instead of taking any time to make the characters  situations funny   heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters  situations pathetic    she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless   nor any of that film s interest in lively plotting   not surprisingly   since clueless s plot came via jane austen s emma      she simply turns the film into a pity party    since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character   you might think that those characters would be interesting   or at least slightly complicated    instead   you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there s no reason to watch them    paul isn t just a nice guy   he s flawless   consequently   he s a central character who does absolutely no growing    his roommates aren t just inconsiderate   they re actively evil blackmailing professor alcott   drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name    and professor alcott isn t just manipulative   he turns dora into his house slave    dora s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser   and even that isn t explored in sufficient detail    there s more ambiguity in the 30 second snippet from alan cumming s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations   it s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush    and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow        i don t know        comic    still   i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora    that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel s   scarborough fair canticle      instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink a reference to the graduate   a hint that paul is becoming an overly sensitive clich heckerling plays it deadly straight    even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist s foibles   she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint    clueless s cher had her self absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness    in loser   amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness   her one show of wit involves naming paul s dorm   hunt s hall   after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall      her gift with casting proved to be her curse    loser may be a crashing bore   but gee   aren t those two kids swell

1441	1	after hearing reviews for woody allen s upteenth movie in history     celebrity     range from terribly boring to just so so   my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of   manhattan     my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time    woody allen s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair   so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand in hand     manhattan   really is one of the best looking films i ve ever seen   beautiful black and white photography of the city s best areas   etc       a fan can t help but feel visibly moved    the film opens up   with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds   and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack   but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky   with the word   help   being spelled with an airplane    beethoven s 5th blasts on the soundtrack    the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment   and it s all rather lovely to look at    and then we cut to a film crew   shooting this as the film s hilariously banal key moment in the film   where the lead actress in the film   melanie griffith   looking as buxom and beautiful as ever   has to realize something s wrong with her life or whatever    it s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film   with the great opening shots or without   and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again   a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works   though   for the record   last year s   deconstructing harry   came awfully close      what the hell has happened to him    the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny   but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas       bullets over broadway     though wonderful   relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off       mighty aphrodite   is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story       everyone says i love you   was more of a great idea than a great film    even   deconstructing harry   is admittingly cheap in a way   even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films    if anything   the reception of   celebrity   by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time   it s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is   it s him       celebrity   is   yes   a good film   but it s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film    instead of creating the great woody allen world   he s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about    and he s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities   so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections    it s like   la dolce vita   without the accuracy   the right amount of wit   and the correct personal crisis    woody   becoming more insecure in his old age   choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities   and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny   and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead    much has been said about his performance   dead on but irritating   makes one yearn for the real thing   blah blah blah   but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh s performance   though featuring some of the same mannerisms   stuttering   whining   lots o  hand gestures     is hardly a warts and all impersonation    branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm   which actually allows for his character s flaws to be more apparent    woody s a flawed guy   and we know it   but we love him anyway   because he s really funny and really witty and really intelligent    branagh s allen is a bit more flat out bad   but with the same charm so that   yes   we like him   but we re still not sure if he s really a good person or not    his character   lee simon   is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie   hits on extra actress winona ryder   then goes off to interview griffith   who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her   and she denies him       sorta    we then learn   through flashbacks   that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion    he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts   covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate   so that he can meet them   and maybe sell his script   a bank robbery movie   but with a deep personal crisis        as such   he has divorced his wife of several years   allen regular judy davis     and continues on a quest for sexual happiness   boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film    after griffith comes his escapades with a model   charlize theron   who is   polymorphously perverse     glad to see allen is using new jokes   ha ha     who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of   la dolce vita      following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen   a relationship that almost assures him success   and his continued escapades with ryder   whom he fancies most of all    his story is juxtaposed with that of davis   who flips out   but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome   friendly tv exec   joe mantegna   who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status    while lee is fumbling about   selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness   davis becomes happy     i ve become the kind of woman i ve always hated       and  i m loving it        without doing a thing    the result is a film of highs and mediums    the mediums are what take up most of the film   with sitations and scenes which don t exactly work but you can t help but pat allen on the back for trying    but other places are really great scenes    the opening    the sequence with theron   which is so good that i wished it hadn t ended    a banana scene with bebe neuwirth   droll as ever      and   perhaps the best sequence   a romp with hot as hell teen idol   brandon darrow   played by none other than leo dicaprio   who is so un dicaprio esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film   they d never look at him the same way    he ignites the screen with intensity   and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical   and totally heartbreaking for lee   who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read   and finds himself on a wild all day ride with him    they go to atlantic city to watch a fight   they gamble   and they wind up in his hotel room   where darrow gets it on with his flame   gretchen mol   and he lends him one of the leftover groupies    allen s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them   i d almost recommend the film    almost    but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it s a mess   despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself   it s still a smart and insightful film    though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced   some seem too cartoonish   even for this environment     allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities   as it may seem to be   if it were   it d be extremely out of touch     but about those who want to be celebrities   and how they equate celebrity hood with happiness    we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they re really happy   they may appear to be on the surface           but we do get close enough to lee and davis  character    lee is obsessed with the phenomenon   while davis takes is at arm s length   and never gets too involved in what it is   and soon becomes one herself    besides   it s witty   and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen s   that great woody allen feel    it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject   and yes   as a part of woody allen s oeuvre   it s merely a blip   no   annie hall   but it s no   shadows and fog   either     but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him   and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor   like the one in the beginning   and make it work not once but twice

54	0	this feature is like a double header   two sets of clich   s for the price of one    not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts   but the banal rich girl poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure    an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance    the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins   based on a story by falls   merely lobs its plotline at the audience    this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching    summer catch centers around ryan dunne   freddie prinze jr       a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league   supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country    ryan is a blue collar kind of guy    he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod s rich and famous    he also   as we are informed early   his own worst enemy    he has the potential and the talent   but always seems to self destruct at the crucial moment    so   ryan tries to remained focused on baseball    then he meets tenley parrish   jessica biel     daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures    tenley   a name only a hack screenwriter could invent   is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan    if you can t figure out where all this nonsense leads   then you need a remedial course in film viewing    as always prinze is pretty to look at   but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions   puppy dog love   heartbreak   frustration   self loathing or determination    biel cries a lot   while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class conscious father    the only beacon is matthew lillard s fun loving billy brubaker   the team s catcher    summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies   such as bull durham and the natural    no curve balls here   no sliders    every pitch is predictable    a blind umpire could call this movie    summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking    it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn    
779	0	when walt disney pictures announced a live action feature based on the  60s cartoon series of   mr   magoo     special interests groups representing the vision impaired let out a cry of dismay    mr    magoo   they claimed   would be an insult to the men and women they represented    in fact   they were wrong    mr    magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near blind   it s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny   90 minute atrocity    it s stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas    look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases   and you ll see a shocking list of retreads   including 101 dalmatians   george of the jungle   jungle2jungle   that darn cat     flubber   and now mr    magoo    the best of these   george of the jungle   was mildly entertaining    the worst   mr    magoo   exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be    the first problem with mr    magoo is the script    despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft   mr    magoo is comically barren    from beginning to end   there s not a laugh to be found    every attempt at humor    and there are lots of them    falls flat with an audible thud    you d think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film   at least a few would work   but that s not the case    i ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures    then there s leslie nielsen   who looks   sounds   and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character   memorably voiced by jim backus      in the past   nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun    lately   however   he has been getting lazy   taking parts in the likes of dracula   dead and loving it   spy hard   and mr    magoo    even if nielsen was in top form   it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo   especially since we re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film     but   top form   is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here    this is strictly a take the money and  run operation    the story   which   like many disney stories   can be described in one long sentence   magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum   and   as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own   the police mistake him for the robber    the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky   who take their lumps early and often    the bad guys are kelly lynch   who does a lot of martial arts type kicking     nick chinlund   and malcolm mcdowell   who has the good sense to look embarrassed      matt keeslar portrays one of magoo s sidekicks    his nephew   waldo    the bumbling man s other   more interesting companion is a dog named angus    most of mr    magoo s humor comes in the form of failed slapstick    the cartoon violence level in this film doesn t approach that of home alone 3 or flubber   but it s still pretty acute   with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices    there s a non violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better   but   compared to mr   bean s recent   similar misadventure   it doesn t hold up well    then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo s near blindness   such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby    i m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack    tong   a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market   has helmed several jackie chan movies   including first strike   rumble in the bronx   and supercop    his chief talent   that of choreographing martial arts fights   is wasted here   despite some high kicking by kelly lynch      like john woo   hard target   and ringo lam   maximum risk   before him   it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream    it is worth noting that   unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under 10 crowd while driving parents to distraction   mr    magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages    the screening i attended was wall to wall kids   and   for the most part   they didn t seem to be enjoying themselves    when the film was over   i asked one little girl what she thought of it    her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words    mr    magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer   sight unseen    
863	0	i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year   when matthew perry had just signed on    i m big fan of perry s subtle sense of humor   and in addition   i think chris farley s on edge   extreme acting was a riot    so naturally   when the trailer for   almost heroes   hit theaters   i almost jumped up and down    a soda in hand   the lights dimming   i was ready to be blown away by farley s final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry s big breakthrough    i was ready to be just amazed   for this to be among farley s best   in spite of david spade s absence    i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran    sadly   none of this came to pass    the humor is spotty at best   with good moments and laughable one liners few and far between    perry and farley have no chemistry   the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade   for it s his type of humor   and not at all what perry is associated with    and the movie tries to be smart   a subject best left alone when it s a farley flick    the movie is a major dissapointment   with only a few scenes worth a first look   let alone a second    perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie   and not surprisingly   the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley    and farley s classic humor is widespread   too    almost heroes almost works   but misses the wagon train by quite a longshot    guys   let s leave the exploring to lewis and clark   huh    stick to   tommy boy     and we ll all be   friends

476	0	how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres    isn t there a law or something    this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg s dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst    mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison    writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill    the plot   for what its worth   concerns two brothers   nathan lane and an appalling lee evens   who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father    deciding to check out the long abandoned house   they soon learn that it s worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder    but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse   happy with his run down little abode and wanting it to stay that way    the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe    whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue   terrible overacting   and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury   signifying nothing    the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is     i hate that mouse      oh cringe    this is home alone all over again   and ten times worse    one touching scene early on is worth mentioning    we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall    he jumps into a tiny bed   pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep   seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone    it s a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film    a message to speilberg   if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility   then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors    this kind of rubbish will just not do at all    
1656	1	the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year    we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics   loved by the people   and make tons of money at the box office    this year   the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic   the mummy    i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies   and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them    that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza    in the mummy   the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o connell    he teams up with a curious   clumsy librarian named evelyn   played by rachel weisz   to find the mysterious city of the dead   hamunaptra    evelyn loves egypt   and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable    rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle   and that s why she chose him to lead her there    also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn s brother   jonathan   played by john hannah   sliding doors      now in hamunaptra   the three uncover   the book of the dead      the curious evelyn unlocks the book   reads from it   and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep   arnold vosloo   becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book    along with imhotep arising from the dead   the ten curses of egypt become in full effect   launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra    not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him   he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt    don t expect huge things out of the mummy   but just expect to have a good time    this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects   which may turn off some viewers    on the other hand   this type of film is one of my favorites   but that s up to you to decide    there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though    the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world    we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert   swarms of beetles and locusts   and even creatures crawling under a human s skin    these may have been in other movies before   but not like in the mummy    as of now   the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year   but all this could change when star wars episode 1   the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country    in the past   brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles    when playing   george   in disney s george of the jungle   he was mainly not known by anyone    i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name   and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens    in the mummy   fraser gets to play an action hero   and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role   as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle    although brendan fraser is great   rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast    weisz really reminded me of a character from an old   horror film    the way she acts   looked   and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time    evelyn is probably the only character that was likable   considering that the other characters   like john hannah s   didn t get much personal attention    in many films   when different genres are mixed   the mixing usually works   and i like it for the most part    in the mummy though   not all of the mixing works    there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror   some with potential comedy   some with potential drama   and some with potential pure action   but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work    the mummy could have gotten an   a   rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these    i didn t mind the corny one liners here and there during action sequences   but it certainly could have done without them    the cinematography is amazing in the mummy    particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt   we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt   mummies   and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians    the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography    from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits   the costumes are always top notch    the bottom line  with the mummy   the summer is off to its usually great start    
853	0	don t get me wrong    i tend to appreciate besson s naive   unashamedly romantic worldview   an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood    his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving   thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman   and 1997 s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love   l u v   that s even more of a hoot on repeated viewings    but his joan of arc is a mess   despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself    jovovich   besson s own personal muse through the making of his last two films   though they ve since separated     is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan   as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior   but also a fabulous   supermodel level babe      and besson remains a servicable action film director   though not an especially facile one    leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english   joan s struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring   and besson helps you understand how the french could believe   fervently   that god is on her side    besson s big mistake   i think   is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject    yes   joan had visions    but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue eyed christ figure on display in besson s hallucinatory dream sequences    the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman   billed as   the conscience     shows up   spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell   babbling like ally mcbeal    that s kind of a shame   since she does quite well up to that point   charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness    that darkly attractive aspect of her character    that she s as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord    is more or less betrayed by the final reels   in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she s overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who s about to take a fall    as the story winds down   with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire   besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance    trouble is   he s chosen a lurid   often jokey tone for the balance of the picture    including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes    and it s impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is   to a great extent   nothing more than a put on    this glib   pre fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer s the passion of joan of arc   1928     a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan s trial   and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema    compared to that film   the messenger plays as a crime against history                                                                   directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france usa   1999  theatrical aspect ratio   2   35   1

183	0	as with any gen x mtv movie   like last year s dead man on campus     the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points   sex and football    those two items   wrapped in a guilty pleasure package   are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially   but sales will decline for two reasons    first   the football sequences are nothing new   nor can they be   the sports genre isn t mainstream and it s been retread to death    second   the sex is just bad    despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all night strip club party   there s nothing even remotely tantalizing    the acting is mostly mediocre   not including the fantastic jon voight    cultivating his usual sliminess   voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer    kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes  twenty two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years   this year he plans to make it twenty three    unfortunately   when his star quarterback   lance harbor   paul walker     goes down for the count   he s got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon   james van der beek      moxon leads the team through its last four games   and then must cope with his newfound stardom   the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie   amy smart     and other temptations that abound in football crazy west canaan    most regions of the country are not nearly as football crazy as texas   and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most    similarly   the set design is wrong for a high school setting   the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms   radio headsets   which never seem to work   however   and instead require coaches to signal plays manually     and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer    these elements   as well as the heavy drinking and carousing   might be more appropriate on a college campus    but mtv s core audience is the high school demographic    this focus is further emphasized by the casting   james van der beek   of tv s   dawson s creek     is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero   although he never manages to do anything with the role    other stars are similarly young and unmemorable    there s not much that goes right about varsity blues   and there s not much to like about it   either    everything herein has already been done   and if it hasn t   the movie manages to botch it one way or another    this is certainly missable    
745	0	in   gia     angelina jolie plays the titular character   the first so called supermodel    and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome   in my eyes   anyway      i just don t see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film    despite this   i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie    sadly   though   my fears were realized    it s just not possible to make an interesting   full length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes    the movie follows the rise and fall of gia   no last name     a tumultuous woman who doesn t particularly enjoy the world of fashion    she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle   and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have    the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high   losing a job   and going into rehab    this formula is repeated several times   and i really got tired of it    in general   i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use    no because it offends me or anything like that   it just bores me    quite frankly   i don t see the appeal   so when a director shows me a point of view shot of a junkie   complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices   i am left somewhat unimpressed    the first hour of the film   though   was actually quite engaging    we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend    these early scenes were interesting    we re shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes   and it was a perspective i hadn t seen before    the movie begins to go downhill   however   once gia becomes an established model     from that point   i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end    it all seemed so excessive    fine   so gia had a drug problem   does this really need to dominate the film    couldn t the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs    or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world    quite possibly   although since i have no desire to become a model   this warning is lost on me    as i stated at the beginning of this review   i simply don t see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature length motion picture    what do they do that warrants a movie    strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour    i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players   for example   but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life    gia did not    and by the end of the film   all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling   was bi sexual   and was heavily into drugs    not exactly a meaningful contribution to society   as far as i m concerned

1736	1	i remember making a pact   right after  patch adams    to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality    but darn it    music of the heart  is just layered with feel good material and bright characterizations    it s hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it s manipulation    in addition   it s also a terrific family film    this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari   who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools    it could also be described as  mrs    streep s opus     yes   meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari   and that brings both good news and bad    out of the gate   possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing   it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta s character and grasp her academic point of view    she is very strict with her students   but what insight does that create into the story    slowly but surely   we begin to recognize the intentions of the character   and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied    one thoroughly interesting fact about  music of the heart  lies with the unlikely presence in the director s chair   horror veteran wes craven    after leaving an impression with the  scream  films and the original  nightmare on elm street    craven has attempted a precarious cross over to drama    at first   his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious   but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material    it doesn t carry the heart warming courage of  mr    holland s opus    but  music of the heart  is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth    the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate    yes   oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep   but it s the solid ensemble cast that makes  music of the heart  work    angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams   the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn t hire roberta because of her lack of experience    blue eyed adian quinn is endearing   as always   playing a new love interest    gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second grade teacher   and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force    it s like a schoolteacher s version of  thelma and louise    in a restrained but effective manner    the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari s teaching of violin    there s some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons   who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman    in it s dramatic build up   the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth    it s a good movie for anyone to see   although missing out on the experience would not be a life altering decision    it s commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross over   and also for achieving his intricate goal    watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments   who may ask yourself   this is the guy who directed  scream     of course   when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000   with craven directing     you may find yourself wondering   this is the guy who directed  music of the heart     mission accomplished   wes    thankfully   there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film    in it s entirety   it s a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family   despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile    the child actors are cute and perform up to par   even if some of their problems are clich   d and predictable in the extreme    the mother who doesn t want her son to be learning  white man s music    the unexpected casuality        basically everything is there    it doesn t strike the perfect chord   but  music of the heart  is highly convincing    the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better   but  music of the heart  is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals

263	0	while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation   we had yet another shoddy   subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks    and   once again   we have one of the worst films of the year    the trend of the moment   and bear in mind it s a trend not a movie   is spawn   and if you ve seen the animated series on hbo you ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man   an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment   he s been sent to hell    todd mcfarlane   the creator of the spawn comic book   must have had a tough time sitting through spawn   for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects   style over substance   ambience over anything else    not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects   the story   about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of   bad guys   and   find himself   in the process is realized in such a sordid   incapable manner   it becomes indigestible after a while    every character in this film is lifeless   vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student    the story begins   like in every superhero movie in this age   with a man living an idyllic life    al simmons   michael jai white     a government agent assassin shares the love of his wife   wanda   theresa russell   and daughter   has a tongue in cheek   wiseass partner   terry   d   b sweeney   and is content with the job his boss   jason wynn   martin sheen     provides him    the next element in the film is the part when things go awry    and as expected   everyone turns the tables on poor al    as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant   al is befriended by jason   and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene    inevitably   it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away    hence   jason s mischievous master mind plan   to   conquer the world   is just commencing its initial stages   when al makes a pact with satan himself   agreeing to command the devil s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again    so   our pal al has been uplifted to hell   and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place   his ol  partner terry forms a relationship with his wife    time passes    and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city   the ghetto where cog   nicol williamson   teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts   his motorbike   armor   etc        this character is merely a poor man s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla    now the stage is set spawn   the new  enemy of evil  vs evil    and evil takes the cake   doubtlessly    john leguizamo s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film s relief point    all this anguish   pain   half baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo   who steals the show and derives joy from his character   which is basically a compilation of so so one liners    and then there s martin sheen    whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years    his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent    as the megalomaniac boss   his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b movie   scrambled   and left in the shelf to rot    this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street    i d never thought i d be saying this   but at this juncture   charlie sheen s career is in better shape    spawn is a movie in which realism   or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable    for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling   jumping through roofs   and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better    it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie   a very bad superhero movie    continually the film kept on depending on special effects   and sadly   this is how pictures are being made    perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry    the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible    the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting    it is perceptible that director mark dippe   attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton s batman did touch   the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act    but bruce wayne had human elements to him    he was pensive   resourceful and had relationships   which made our perspective on him equally human    the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change   as if he s fatigued about being normal    and as all superheroes   batman   superman   the phantom   they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary    none of this is present in spawn    the fighting sequences are weakly executed   the dialogue is penny dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner s    as an example of this film s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten   and then rescued by spawn   so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic    admittedly   i did laugh once in the film   and that s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum    it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature    besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system   i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn    movies that present no admiration   no captivation   no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to    and kids will continue to see films like spawn   simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative   wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one    children are not muppets    and spawn unapologetically targets children

1103	1	after a stylistic detour with mrs    parker and the vicious circle   which   despite its uncomfortable tone   was close to being a conventional movie     director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow   a romantic black comedy about love   betrayal   and self absorption    while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture   rudolph s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing   if not always pleasant   movie    it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director   meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it    until mrs    parker   i had not been overly impressed by his movies    i found equinox   his last pre  mrs    parker effort   to be irritating and frustrating    i was somewhat surprised   therefore   to discover that i liked afterglow    there are several reasons for this   but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident   mannered aspects of his approach    the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems   the story is absorbing   and the acting is top notch    in short   rudolph has created a world that it s worth spending two hours in    afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples    jeffrey byron   jonny lee miller   is a cold   seemingly heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife   marianne   lara flynn boyle      for her part   marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level    all she s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she s ovulating    after he refuses to make love   she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor    the other couple   lucky   nick nolte   and phyllis mann   julie christie     are an older pair   but they re no more content than jeffrey and marianne    a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart    they remain married as a matter of convenience   but   since phyllis won t allow lucky to touch her   they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs    the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable    the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey    the two of them are immediately attracted to one another   and it doesn t take long before they re lounging together   naked   in her pool    meanwhile   jeffrey   who is captivated by older women   runs into phyllis in a hotel bar   is smitten   and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains    the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love    sex means something different to everyone   to jeffrey   it s an unpleasant chore   a loss of control   to marianne   it s a means to a maternal end   to lucky   it s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles   and to phyllis   it s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness    ultimately   none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves    the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script   but in the performances    jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish   callous   suit and tie businessman    those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity    lara flynn boyle   who wasn t impressive in rudolph s equinox   is greatly improved   making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability    nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky   and he manages to deliver some of rudolph s most pregnant lines with practiced ease    the clear standout   however   is julie christie   who is nothing short of delicious as the world weary phyllis    her often wry   occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film s humor   and there s hardly ever a moment when she doesn t steal the spotlight from her co stars    i don t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph  detractors   but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director s earlier productions    enough of his trademark style remains   however   to reassure his supporters    afterglow is basically a four pronged character study    the plot is not especially compelling   but the character interaction is   and that s the real reason to see this motion picture    rudolph has painted an able picture of the non romantic side of love    the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction    
1742	1	a couple of months ago   when i first downloaded the face off trailer from the net   my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold  yawn     followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key   not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss poor trailer    then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u   s           unique       excellent         must see    well   i thought still skeptical   i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here     here    of course   was still three months away    i ll admit   when i trotted off to see this film   the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow    i d heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled   but his films were definitely not on my must see list    that   let me tell you   has changed completely    i knew this fact only five minutes into the film   after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet    the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick    seriously    i ve never been a big john travolta fan   but he   like cage   perfectly suited his role in the movie           sorry    make that  roles  in the movie    even travolta s great performance   however   paled in comparison to cage s character portrayals    my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler s hideout    half drugged out of his mind   he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son s death from castor s perspective     doesn t it just break your heart     he mutters coldly    now don t go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie   it s not    that s what really makes this movie unique    it s an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters           not a common mix at all    suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though           that s  the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other         and  never hit    several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press  rewind  and watch it over again    the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double sided mirror is just plain brilliant    whilst cage s and travolta s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies   the lesser characters are just as intriguing    joan allen   who usually sticks to the straight drama movies   plays her part perfectly as archer s long suffering wife    i like the fact that her character didn t end up toting a gun at the end of the movie       it  would have wrecked her potrayal    gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy s mistreated girlfriend           make that   one of   castor troy s mistreated girlfriends    other movies would have used her character as just window dressing       a  sex object   but instead her character is very strong and independent    dominique swain   who plays archer s daughter   also does a nice job   though her character is not as explored as much as allen s or gershon s    faults   well       there were some i have to say    first   the movie s ending   whilst being very good overall   was a bit too drawn out for it s own good    after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can t help but think     geez   are you guys nuclear powered or what        there were certain bits that weren t handled properly   like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform prison   more explanation here would have been nice    overall   this movie was not perfect    but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect    many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made           i  certainly hope so    
177	0	capsule   one of the ten worst movies ever made    christopher lambert vs   evil ninjas in modern day japan        and nobody wins    the hunted is such a bad movie   so completely inept and so totally brain damaged that i could almost feel affection for it    i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it   if it weren t also insanely xenophobic and insulting    christopher lambert plays a computer parts salesman who s on business in japan    he meets a slinky young woman   joan chen   and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her    and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader   john lone      apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered    since lambert is a witness   he s of course the next one to die    let s stop and think about this for a second    if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society   he d have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock    in this movie   the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him    i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body    you know what a goof field is   that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is    this is   of course   only the beginning of the movie s problems    lambert eventually finds pseudo safety with a long haired modern day samurai   yoshio harada   and his partner    yoko shimada   who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun    they are the two best things in the movie   in every scene they have authority and presence   and they actually look like they belong here   even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows    the script doesn t know what the hell to do with them    lone   as the bad guy   is zero dimensional    the only bad guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him    in the hunted   this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype    what s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes    there s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver   and a girl in a pachinko parlor    but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful    also   the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack    get the cd    that manages to survive despite the drek it s been designed to accompany    there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing    a gory   excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment   and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re couple the whole thing with the movie s relentlessly stupid plot    by the time we get to the final showdown   with lambert getting to wield his own sword   which   judging from the ham handed editing of one scene   was forged in seven hours or so     we no longer care    we re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies    someone once said that the key to good art    good movies   good books   whatever    is to start somewhere interesting   end up somewhere interesting   and show respect for the audience all along the way    this movie bungles two out of three   badly

1822	1	i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars    from my first viewing   i noticed that david mamet s film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning    from my second viewing however   i noticed that mamet s script was actually a masterpiece    the spanish prisoner   like the usual suspects or chinatown   begs for the viewer s complete attention    miss a scene or even a small detail   and you could miss the meaning of the entire film    also like the aforementioned films   it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending    mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games    like his past gem   the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much   or even more   than the victim    because we were deceived just like the victim   we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film    mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped   but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end    the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over   without giving a right answer   is unique and ingenious    the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued    after seeing the film again   i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening    his direction is very subtle   as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them   or think you see all of them    the story follows a young up and coming businessman   joe ross     campbell scott   who has just created a mysterious and lucrative   process   that everyone is trying to get their hands on    soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his   process      through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters   the rich and popular jimmy dell   a secretary who has a huge crush on ross   and ross  boss mr   klein    played by steve martin   rebecca pidgeon   and ben gazarra respectively   the supporting cast is very solid especially martin   who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role    the most interesting character in the film   though   was campbell scott s joe ross    the character s transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable    david mamet s script is so interesting because we know people don t actually talk like the characters in the film   yet we feel so connected to some of them    his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge    this is a must see   for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie    
417	0	it s been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci fi opus  mission to mars    and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar    why    the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy   stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera   instead shooting for the angle of a feel good science fiction drama more akin to  2001   a space odyssey     i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie going patrons were expecting another  armageddon     but no    mission to mars  certainly isn t one large action sequence about colossal disaster    this is a supposedly thoughtful   family friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel    you have been warned    of course   crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible   see  apollo 13  for an excellent example     but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation    brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off    when he gets his hands on an intelligent   systematically practical script like  the untouchables  or  mission   impossible    the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement   although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally      of course   there s also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name   including  snake eyes  and the notorious bomb  the bonfire of the vanities             all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood    that term may be too harsh   but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is  mission to mars    my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient    if i were gary sinise   i wouldn t touch de palma with a 10 foot pole    sinise is a wonderful   wonderful actor   but after appearing in  snake eyes  and this vomit inducing sham   i m sure he wouldn t want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration    the academy award winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell   a man who recently lost his wife   kim delaney   and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars   oops   forgot to mention the year   2020      after a barbecue get together for the astronauts   we cut to luc goddard   don cheadle   and his team   who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet    suddenly   a towering formation of rocks and soil   probably best dubbed a  sand tornado    appears and creates a whirlwind of suction    for some reason   the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this   as if it were a lovely piece of art    the team is killed within seconds   expect for luc   who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive    immediately   a second mission   consisting of astronauts mcconnell   husband and wife woody and terri blake   tim robbins and connie nielsen   and phil ohlmyer   jerry o connell     are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars    let s put the  secret  on hold for now   and discuss the trip there    it is explained   whether scientifically accurate or not   probably not     that a trip to mars takes roughly six months    i m not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind  m2m  didn t capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia    instead   we join the team during their final days aboard the ship    what happened during the five months prior to this    did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes    still   there are few nicely tense moments   maybe the only in the movie   during the time frame involving a fuel leak    depalma s direction is quite good in these scenes   although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent   organ music in space    c mon      there s a few good   imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese   a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud    it s a colossal bummer that  mission to mars  is poorly assembled and laughably written   with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists    as mentioned before   anyone looking for some disaster movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed        maybe even cheated    after the unbelievably hokey final shot   with the words   the end  somehow adding insult to injury     a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen    others muttered obscenities   shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling  jeez   that sucked      okay   it did suck    but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy        after all   they do pretty well    sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes   robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple   and funnyman o connell   well   he has a couple lines are actually amusing   and intentionally so      the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive    so   by golly   where did this  mission  go wrong    looking back on the appalling experience   i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have    while watching  mission to mars    my suggestion would be to immediately abort   or better yet   don t even strap yourself in for lift off    
919	0	michael robbins  hardball is quite the cinematic achievement    in about two hours   we get a glancing examination of ghetto life   a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy   speeches about never giving up   a cache of cute kids   including a fat one with asthma     a hard luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic   big game     where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined    all that s needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich   s    i can t wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd    obviously   hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball    it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler   who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam    out of solutions   he begs his successful corporate friend   the always welcome mike mcglone   to lend him  5   000    instead   mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend    reeves   who wants to keep his fingers   accepts the offer   but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely    the drowsy voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs    and maybe   just maybe   they ll play in the big championship game    one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins   summer catch     adapted from daniel coyle s non fiction book   is that there aren t any    the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie    that wouldn t be so bad   if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them    most of the kids  time is spent yelling at each other   talking in slang and acting surprised    there s little that s naturally amusing about them   as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling    the worst of the lot is a tough talking younger player   dewayne warren   whose sole purpose   as the movie unfolds   is being an emotional pawn   a tactic so utterly despicable i can t find the right words to express myself    the adults also don t fare well    reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down on his luck loser    the character is poorly written   but reeves gives another charisma free performance    every time he speaks   he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up    kids are supposed to rally around this guy    diane lane   who co stars as reeves  obligatory love interest   remains a glowing screen presence   see my dog skip for better proof      it s too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like     these kids trust you   and they don t trust anyone      then there s d   b    sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves  scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you ve seen before and hope never to see again    i wanted hardball to be good    robbins  varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved    i haven t seen robbins  goofy ready to rumble in its entirety   but i am intrigued that   macho man   randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions    robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte    making sports movies for guys and not cutesy   cuddly pap such as hardball   which also manages to annoy and insult the audience    here s hoping that happens in the immediate future

1269	1	while it was part of former yugoslavia   my country   croatia   used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general    words   croatia   and   croatians   were unheard   even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations    the rare exception was the dogs of war   1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth s bestselling novel   yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury   by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context    in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people   probably terrorists   who happen to remove parts of arm dealers  stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise    same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place   dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business   politics and crime    the movie protagonist   shannon   christopher walken   is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe    his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro    shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba   bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away    after being arrested and tortured by kimba s secret police   shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north   colin blakely      upon return   he is approached by mining company again   but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d etat against kimba    shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war    thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies   especially those made in 1980s   is its authenticity   almost close to documentary    it shouldn t surprise anyone   because the author of the novel   frederick forsyth   made reputation by blending fiction with real life   thus creating interesting   exciting yet very believable plots for his books    those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers   and one of them   zinnemman s the day of the jackal   is now considered a classic in that genre    this one deals with soldiers of fortune   ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires    unlike wild geese   that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure   script by george malko and gary de vore   author whose death last year became real life mystery   is serious   and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work    the movie doesn t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes   they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda    christopher walken played in many movies   yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role    his performance in this film perhaps isn t breathtaking   yet adequate    his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned   world  weary man whose alienation from the   normal   way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends    although the movie doesn t lack capable actors   their roles are miniature compared with walken s   and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character    however   those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war   tom berenger   paul freeman   jo beth williams   victoria tennant   in brief cameo     and biggest surprise is ed o neill   of married with children fame   as shannon s reluctant colleague    this was the first major production for john irvin   and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable   yet second class director    with the good script he can make very good movie   with the bad script he can make real mess    luckily   the dogs of war had a good script    irvin s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel    the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon   used on the wrong places    in the final battle scene   where we can see mercenaries at work   irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics   unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes    unfortunately   by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn t help    but   despite those shortcomings   this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty   realistic political drama    
146	0	dead bang   an action thriller starring don johnson   lives up to its dumb title   or at least to half of it    although dead bang is definitely dead   it is anything but a bang   in fact   they should have called this one   dead bore      in the film   johnson plays        you guessed it        a cop    the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character   jerry beck   is a gritty los angeles homicide detective   a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on   miami vice      a la mel gibson in lethal weapon   beck is an emotional wreck   complete with violent outbursts   unscrupulous police methods   and a bleak outlook on life    beck s wife has just divorced him   and she is cutting him off from their children    she will not even allow him to wish them   merry christmas   by telephone    but beck s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead bang    beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop    his investigation starts in l   a   and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma   where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp    virtually every aspect of dead bang is inept and ineffective    the plot is incoherent and full of holes    the movie depicts beck s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions    the action sequences in dead bang are strictly third rate   and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense    i certainly expected more from long time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller   the manchurian candidate  as well as black sunday   seven days in may   and the french connection ii    in all fairness to frankenheimer   however   i should note that most of dead bang s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction    dead bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy   but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting    according to the movie s production notes   dead bang is based on the real life experiences of still active detective jerry beck    you would never guess this from watching dead bang   however   since the film totally lacks credibility   it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable    most of the characters in dead bang are either atrociously acted   underdeveloped   superfluous   or all of the above    william forsythe   for example   is painfully bad as arthur kressler   a wholesome by the book fbi agent who s offended by beck s foul language and unorthodox methods    forsythe s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable    dead bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid     wkrp in cincinnati   and   frank s place       but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role   he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains    the sole function of penelope ann miller s character is to give dead bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less    i guess the film s title refers to this love scene since it s definitely a dead bang    the only real virtue of dead bang   believe it or not   is don johnson   who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie s pitiful script    johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth   and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life    and i must admit that dead bang does have one or two amusing moments    the funniest scene has johnson throwing up all over a criminal as he interrogates him    but when barf is the highlight of a movie   you know the movie s in trouble    the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck   in which he can t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen    but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make    
607	0	a fullyloaded entertainment review   website coming soon    hunter s   thompson s fear and loathing in las vegas   written in 1971   is already an american classic   not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post psychedelia of the 1960 s   but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as   gonzo      soon after the book was written   hunter s   thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke    and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas   the movie      although the book is one of my favorites   i now agree with thompson s own assessment of the novel as   unfilmable      the main problem is that the book   although detailing wild drug use and tripped out adventures   was not written on the road    it was written and edited by hunter s   thomspons   relatively sober   at his home    so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use   it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor    hunter s   thomspon   the narrator   while always drugged out   still has a grip on reality   and can still tell   with journalistic ability   what is going on around him    not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas    despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped   the movie is an exact duplicate of the book   in terms of dialouge    unfortunately   this can get annoying   in the form of johnny depp s   who plays thompson   excessive narration    and the characters   while having vivid personalities   are played as 2 d characers on the screen   dr   raoul duke   johnny depp   the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson s   and his riding companion   dr   gonzo   benicio del toro     who is a large samoan lawyer   have no personalities or emotions at all   save for stoned    the film is very faithful to the plot   what there is   of the book   in that dr   raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400   and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs    from there   one set of stoned adventures after another happens   including one of the few good scenes in which depp   high on acid   watches all the people in the bar around him turn into   literally   lounge lizards    while the movie has its moments   few     it is almost unwatchable at parts   especially towards the end    despite a lot of celebrity cameos   the stars never get off the ground    the set decoration and costumes are great   and probably deserve an oscar nomination    however   as we all know   it s not sets or effects that make a movie   its the characters   and quite frankly   these characters are no good    
1912	1	it s terribly unfortunate that   stir of echoes     tautly written and directed by david koepp   who made one of 1996 s unsung treasures     the trigger effect       should be released little more than a month after   the sixth sense     which is still going strong at the box office    these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared   judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night     and although they have eerily similar storylines     stir of echoes   is more of a straightforward psychological horror film   while   the sixth sense   is closer to a psychological drama    additionally   while   the sixth sense   had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business     stir of echoes   is more conventional and predictable in its final twist    and where   the sixth sense   was disturbing     stir of echoes   is just plain scary    i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities   and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits    adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago     stir of echoes   opens with a cute six year old boy named jake   zachary david cope   who is taking a bath    he is speaking directly at the screen   but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there    finally   he asks     does it hurt to be dead      apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people   but unlike   the sixth sense     this young child isn t the focus of the picture    instead   tom witzy   kevin bacon     a chicago lineman   is our protagonist    jake is his son   and maggie   kathryn erbe     whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant   is his hard working wife    one night while at a party with their closest friends   tom convinces maggie s new age sister   lisa   illena douglas     to try and hypnotize him    it unexpectedly works   and before long   tom is seeing things he wouldn t normally see   including a deceased teenage girl   jenny morrison   in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months    seeking help from lisa   she tells him that   while he was under hypnosis   she told him that after he awoke   his mind will remain clear and free   like an opened door    she didn t expect it to work   but it did   and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees       stir of echoes   isn t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination   but in the thick   atmospheric mood it conjures up   it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror drama   and is not only effective on a technical level   but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working class family    kevin bacon and   especially   kathryn erbe   1997 s   dream with the fishes       are top notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems    after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions   he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house   and instead of maggie not being understanding   she instead believes what tom says   and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through   does not try to stop his pursuit    bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts   and therefore   are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet    in a masterfully done   entrancing sequence   tom is hypnotized by lisa   but instead of watching him   we instead see what he sees   starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness    lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater   and so   we   as audience members   are watching a movie screen from inside a theater   which is also showing a movie screen in a theater    telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen   we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is   sleep      never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly construed as this one    truthfully   this set piece   and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt   are worth the full price of admission alone   just to see them on the big screen    having loads of fun with her small role as maggie s sister   lisa   illeana douglas   1995 s   to die for     her last great character   is a delight   but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films    funny and enjoyably offbeat   douglas gets to utter the best line in the film   while talking to maggie about tom s visions of the girl   she remarks     i wouldn t be worried about him seeing another girl   although the fact that she s dead gives one pause      also of note are jenny morrison   1994 s   intersection       who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character   and liza weil   remarkable in 1998 s   whatever     as morrison s grieving teenage sister   debbie    if the resolution of   stir of echoes   does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential   and it doesn t     what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty    the music score   by james newton howard   and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects   successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into   and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically written characters       stir of echoes   isn t as good as   the sixth sense     but why should it need to be    both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet   and   stir of echoes   really is a spinetinglingly good horror film

1978	1	robert redford s a river runs through it is not a film i watch often    it is a masterpiece    one of the better films of recent years    until 1994   it was my second favorite film of all time    the acting and direction is top notch    never sappy   always touching    a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because   i was afraid it would just be really politically correct   and tick me off      all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased   and enjoy    it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears    but certain memories should not often be rereleased    in the last few shots   you have to cry    upon my first viewing i left bawling    it is not flawless    but it is so very good   that you can t help but be effected    the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental    watching these shots of people who have been dead so long   gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films    martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state    like taking dope   and immersing yourself in an alternative world    that is what a river runs through it does    it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self    both times i ve seen it   its been hard   again to quote scorsese   waking up    but the dream is lovely    
135	0	here s a concept    jean claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie    now if that isn t enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie   i don t know what is    all sarcasm aside   it is certainly a different way to start a movie   of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother    so lucky us   we get to see more of jean claude    van damme  1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives    van damme  2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after  1 gets killed in france    the remaining twin   the french cop   goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death    once there   he hooks up with his deceased brother s girlfriend   played by natasha henstridge   and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are    jean claude s acting abilities don t seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie    in other words   just in case you missed the sarcasm   his acting is worse than normal    on the upside   natasha henstridge is in this film   and she does what she did best in species    she gets naked    sadly   this is probably the high point in the movie    she is actually a decent actress   but didn t improve as much as i thought she would after species    this is the typical van damme movie   with jean claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents    nothing new here   and certainly nothing we haven t seen in every other van damme movie    simply put   there is absolutely nothing new about this movie    it has a retread plot    this isn t the first time jean claude has played twins    he still can t act    we all saw natasha s breasts in species   although this is one repeat performance i m not complaining about      this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in    sub par    
1033	1	you ve heard all the hype    you ve seen all their faces   natalie portman   the professional   as queen amidala   liam neeson   schindler s list   as qui gon jinn   ewan mcgregor   trainspotting   as obi wan kenobi   and jake lloyd   jingle all the way   as young anakin skywalker    if you ve read any reviews   you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy    you also may have heard that this one s too kiddie friendly   and doesn t have enough content for adults    believe the hype    the effects are stunning   the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic   the lightsaber duels are amazing   and queen amidala s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth    but there s something missing here   and it isn t budget or effects   it s everything money   can t   buy    the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat characters    the most successful at this is liam neeson who   as qui gon jinn   a jedi master to young obi wan kenobi   has quiet dignity and a wise   commanding presence    he is the anchor to this movie   as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out    portman s queen amidala and mcgregor s obi wan kenobi don t fare nearly so well    amidala   the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation             comes off as stoic   stilted and caricatured   it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life      and obi wan   although mcgregor makes him very endearing   has so little screen time that he s nothing but a robin to qui gon jinn s batman    however   mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity   and he does a good job    he also absolutely nails alec guiness    obi wan in episode 4   6   scottish accent   and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise    in fact   lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit   and that s one of the problems with this film    i would never call myself a   star wars   fan   especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days   but i ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america    however   if you are the one person in america who   hasn t   seen the films at all or even recently   or who doesn t bother to brush up on the names of obscure characters   you may be hopelessly lost    for example   one of the film s main   nefarious   characters is senator palpatine    for those of you not recently steeped in   star wars   trivia   emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader s master in   return of the jedi   and   empire strikes back      so   obviously   his appearance in   phantom menace   is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series   thus making his role here more meaningful    a lot of the movie is like that    r2 d2 and c 3po make token appearances   and it s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience s pre existing fondness for them        because he doesn t do much to add to it in any way    same goes for jabba the hutt   who doesn t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy    even   planets   make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film   tatooine   the desert world where luke grew up     coruscant   the cloud city from   empire strikes back       and alderaan   leia s home planet   which we never actually see   that gets blown up in   star wars     show up or are mentioned briefly in passing    what s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films    the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty    there s no meat   no substance   that makes you want to love the characters as they are   not as they will be    another problem is that there are actually   too many   alien characters in the film    i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters   strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters   had mouths that barely moved   making them look more like muppets than actual characters    and jar jar binks   a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character   is intended as comic relief   but what he really becomes is annoying   and fast    unlike chewbacca and c 3po   who got their humanity   if you ll pardon the expression   from their interactions with the human characters   jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind   at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive   teenage mutant ninja turtles      furthermore   the dialogue is often stilted and corny   and sometimes downright infantile   thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot    oddly   this isn t just   my   judgment   lucas has said that he designed this film for kids    well   he s done a good job    the hero of this film   of course   is young anakin   but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy    that s not jake lloyd s fault   though   he does a good job of being a cute kid   which is apparently all lucas asked of him    that s another mistake   of course   because the cute tyke becomes darth vader    warning   spoilers ahead          in my opinion   there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin s future evil in the film    the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks   and there s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie    he has a doting mother   pernilla august   making her first english  language film   and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine    but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn t all hearts and roses is yoda s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui gon jinn    his explanation       his future is clouded         warning   major spoiler ahead    enter at your own risk      of course   the noble qui gon dies at the hand of darth maul   a scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts   but has turned to the dark side    this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie   but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber   and his scary facial makeup    because qui gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force   obi wan   qui gon s young padawan apprentice   one level below knightdom     must take over the training himself    so   at the end of the movie   we end where the saga actually begins   with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice   anakin   darth vader   skywalker    did this story need to be told    i would say no    but is it a worthwhile movie to see    absolutely    if you don t enter the theater with jedi size expectations   and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle   then this is your movie    the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation    the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight    and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler   happier time    above all   this is a fun movie    not deep   not meaningful   and not profound    but fun    maybe next time   lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script   and the guy who directed   empire   will direct    because if lucas does the next one himself   it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most   potential          
99	0	another formula  feel good  quirky comedy from the british isles   much like   waking ned devine     and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line    it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town   such as tolerant vicars and policemen   plenty of eccentrics   and of locals who stick together through thick and thin    the strength of this film lies in its rational theme   that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol    the film is tolerable until after its first hour   it then falls completely apart   becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas    but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to   at least   be viewed as containing a pertinent message    its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the  war on drugs  is about to be escalated into colombia    the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future   it has so far just ended up causing america s jails to be overcrowded with non violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america s drug usage and drug supply    billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war   by backing a corrupt government   remember vietnam     with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country    everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam   with this scenario closer to home   so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war    the film s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public   something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago   is a theme long overdue for public acceptance   but one that is better received late than never    there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this   rather than making it a police matter altogether    the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle aged woman   grace   brenda blethyn     who fell out of an airplane   evidently committing suicide    the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined    he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up   without her knowledge   their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage    the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless    she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london   honey   quick      what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying   is that when conferring with honey   she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her    even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can   the creditors swoop down on her like vultures    her gardener and handyman   matthew   ferguson     decides to stay on with her   despite his last check bouncing    since she is an expert amateur horticulturist   he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants   which he grows for private use    the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity   as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high quality stuff    for grace   this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt   for the scotsman   matthew   it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky   valerie      the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed   the police sergeant   campbell   pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace s greenhouse is for   the friendly vicar   phillips   counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can t control   and the doctor   clunes   enjoys smoking the weed for recreation    the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big time drug dealer instead of having matthew go   because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn t want matthew to end up in jail    it is interesting to note   that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you   only that one can go to jail    the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london   trying to find a drug dealer   while dressed out of place   in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal   was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole   whereby it never recovered its dignity    the film moves into the formula mode   whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive   as she meets an international drug dealer   a frenchman   tcheky karyo     who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences   thereby becoming a celebrity    things work out in a ridiculous way   where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace   where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood    there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale   as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone   until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded    this  unhip  film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly   but should be tolerated as something naughty middle aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute    ummm    
1926	1	the most amazing thing about paul cox s innocence is how unlike a movie it is    i mean that as the highest compliment    if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40 year old romance   i d want to run and hide    the sex scenes would be handled as a farce   producers would shed 20 years off the characters  ages   so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star   and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence    along with a charming romantic story   the australian belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable    the romance gets started when former musician andreas   charles   bud   tingwell     learns that his true love   claire   julia blake     lives nearby    they decide to catch up on old times   but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair    complicating matters is andreas  frail health   and claire s longtime husband   terry norris     who can t understand why he s suddenly become obsolete    in my mind   the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire   than the feelings of everyone involved    john   claire s husband   endlessly questions what he did wrong    claire initially insists she s a grown up   but admittedly behaves like a child   a prospect that thrills and disappoints her    andreas   an agnostic   begins to question his fate   a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence    cox litters the movie with flashbacks   including the repeated vision of a roaring train    it s a reminder of andreas and claire s past love   as young lovers   they met by train     but as it recurs   we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed    a pall is cast on the whole affair    a master of the understated   cox strings together a series of memorable moments    in andreas  dream sequence   amidst the roar of the train and conversations   we get the whole picture of andreas and claire s love    we also get glimpses into john and claire s relationship    during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward   claire admits to john about her indiscretion   telling more than any monologue could    all that s heard is the scraping of forks against plates    the characters are unlike anything i ve seen    they re people    so many times   movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky    or they re reduced to comedic buffoons    ordinary people with a pile of emotions   claire and andreas aren t sure what the next step is    they do want to be happy   which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they ve known throughout their adult lives    bravo to cox   who wrote the script   for not making john a monster   so that claire s affair is automatically justified    norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire s love difficult to accept    we feel for him    he s a decent man    sure   he may have become complacent   but he never expected this   especially now    with so much presented to the audience   it s only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive   which it does    however   in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers   cox displays a skill and   lan isn t likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon    
544	0	vikings v   bears    no   this isn t the lineup for monday night football    rather   these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in   the 13th warrior     a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory    based on michael crichton s book   eaters of the dead   this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought    their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword    luckily for the vikings   however   their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film    antonio bandaras is ahmed   a travelling ambassador    accompanied by his friend   omar shariff in a cameo     they eventually come across a small viking village    we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude    they laugh heartily   revel in their arrogance   and sing songs of battles won    but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land    help is needed quickly    an elderly   fortune telling witch arrives    after a brief incantation   she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more   not of norse blood   are needed to ensure victory    personally   i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity    nonetheless   12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th    the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives    of course during their ride   ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors    but he ably shows that it s not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog    he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings   but will his skills   and that of the group   be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside    it does not look promising    these creatures   resembling bears   are strong and have high morale    they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies    they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon    the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods    they are ready to sacrifice their lives       this is a good way to die     says one of the fallen warriors    despite the larger than life battle sequences   i was unmoved by the entire experience    at many points   i was even confused    for example   somewhere in the middle of the film   a sub plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land    he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis    however   the sub plot never fully materializes   and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion    there are other questions that i had   but the real problem was that the story   little of it that there was   offered no characters to love or hate    the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma    however   banderas s role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special    an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order    also   much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night   which made battles very difficult to follow    i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy    as it stands   the film manages more confusion than intensity    it would make thor cry

874	0	fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade    tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies   but the quantity    most of those movies were produced by cannon group   company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus    those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman   b  movie mentors of future hollywood legends    unfortunately   that didn t happened   and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade   behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage   that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal    sadly for bronson   that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead   and lowering his own reputation in process    on the other hand   bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular   especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself    one of such movies that seriously marred bronson s reputation is death wish 3   third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974    in the original movie   bronson played paul kersey   mild mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence    that movie was far from masterpiece   yet   in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time   on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry      unfortunately   six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels   even the presence of its original director didn t stop the rapid decline of the quality    death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend   living in the urban wasteland of east new york   populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out    before the reunion   kersey s friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker   played by gavan o herlihy   probably the only noteworthy role in the film      kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade   while the police inspector shriker   ed lauter     ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime    bronson   the main asset in this movie   plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine    although bronson s charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities   single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower     the lack of emotions or bronson s own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film    the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness   so they added romantic interest for their hero   public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey s crusade    on the other hand   emotions are much better played by confronting law abiding   yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks   ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks   and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey    unfortunately   michael winner doesn t know how to work out the plot   and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations   ends this movie with a bang    the big showdown at the end   that turns east new york into the sarajevo like battle zone   is probably the worst part of the movie   because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget    in short   this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia       special note for trekkies   marina sirtis   the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek   the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife      
1266	1	the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy    but after diasappointing films such as   godzilla   and   fear and loathing in las vegas     it would be nice to see a really good film    but i doubt you could have expected this    the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen   and it deserves a spot on the   decade s best   list    there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim     yes   that s what makes this film great      the blend of peter weir s masterful   and in many ways brilliant   direction   peter biziou s stunning photography and jim carrey s performance is what makes this film work so fantastically    there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show    it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame   but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect    carrey has made a very wise choice    by playing mild mannered truman burbank   he allows himself enough room to be comical   and therefore not alienating his true fans   while still showing a vulnerable and human side    that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes    truman burbank was born to an audience of millions    he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show    everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians   led by the show s director   christof   played by ed harris      everyone in truman s life is an actor or an extra    they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe   people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman s life    but he is the only person that is not aware of it    the classification of the truman show may be tricky    the audience reacted to many of truman s revelations with laughter    i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character    the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes   because what was happening to him   indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong    so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy    a drama    it really depends on the audience    but to me   the truman show was a touching   sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others    but above all else   the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor   heart and scary realism    oscar predictions in june are pointless   but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997   as originally planned   james cameron would be oscar less

1738	1	the premise of the new teen targeted horror film  final destination  causes a recollection of a memorable  simpsons  halloween episode    after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster   lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time machine    after a trek into the cretaceous period   homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world    again and again   homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it    the characters of  final destination  have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence   their  design     someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake    that someone is death    you see   alex browning   devon sawa   and six others have cheated the grim reaper          but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve    for a high school excursion   alex s french class is traveling to paris by airline transport    alex   tense and neurotic   has a shocking premonition after boarding   he sees the plane   and every passenger on it   spontaneously explode in mid air    in a panic of sheer lunacy   alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft    after a handful of others   including one teacher   follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane   the unwitting   survivors  watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky    the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize    but death won t be cheated so easily   and one by one   the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances    the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi    before i delve into the meat of the review   i d just like to confer          is that one helluva premise   or what     final destination    creepy beyond rational comprehension   probably reads more like an unsettling  x files  episode than  the simpsons    therefore   the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong    on familiar turf   the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong   and the opening 20 minutes of  final destination  reflects that    unlike most thrillers   the set up is crisp and cool    you just deeply   sincerely hope that the momentum won t unspool   leaving us with a second string effort with nothing but cheap   derivative shocks    young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration   what with  i know what you did last summer  and sequel    idle hands  and    a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil     urban legend     after the set up   when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair   i started to really have fun with  final destination     low and behold   a teen thriller that is actually unsettling   actually suspenseful and    yes    actually intelligent    some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside   this film is among the most refreshing and all out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting edge  scream  in 1996     final destination  stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood spattered slasher crap we ve endured throughout the past few years    not that the characters are that good    sawa is game as alex   a connect the dots personality that we never fully comprehend    in addition   the survivors are endearing geek tod   chad e   donella     jocky control freak carter   kerr smith of  dawson s creek      carter s ditzy girlfriend terry   amanda detmer     the none too subtly named billy hitchcock   seann william scott   supplier of lukewarm comic relief

character named clear rivers   what were her parents thinking            the personality of clear is written with such a vague   nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash card saying  hello   i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character s plight      toss a few stereotypical fbi agents   daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith   and a         ummm         spiritual  mortician   former  candyman  tony todd   into the mix   and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing   dicing and assorted disembowelments    not so     final destination  has no slicing and dicing   or at least none dealt by a human killer   and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening    the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying   murderer on the loose  concept   with assistance from a shrewd   intelligently paced screenplay by morgan   wong and jeffrey reddick    the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity   listen up    reindeer games       but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of  final destination  is the murder scenes    creative   resourceful and breathlessly inventive   the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character s demise    what will trigger the accident    will it be the john denver record   just put on to play  rocky mountain high        yeah   sick humor      will it be the leaking toilet    the falling fishing reel in the corner    the murders are startling and largely unforeseen   including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward    a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach    it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes   but who cares    it s fun    in that simple regard    final destination  is my cup of tea    this stylishly executed thriller   although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue   is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side    after the show   it will also have an frightening impact on you    when will your   design  expire    is death waiting around the corner    the  final  effect is a major case of the heebie jeebies

1820	1	it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival s palme d or   a  100 million plus box office gross   and an oscar nomination   all for his sophomore outing   pulp fiction    since then   the talented film maker has been virtually invisible   surfacing briefly as a co director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire fest   from dusk till dawn    in between   he has moonlighted as an   actor   with several decidedly unmemorable performances    now   with much fanfare and anticipation   tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort   jackie brown    and   while this motion picture   adapted from elmore leonard s novel   rum punch   offers solid entertainment   those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed    for the most part   jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie    the story   which starts out slowly   develops into a twisty affair   with double crosses and triple crosses    and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks   witty dialogue   unexpected gunfire    70s pop tunes   and close ups of womens  bare feet    yet   for all of that   the production is something of a letdown    the sheer   in your face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent    the mostly straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn t match up favorably to the non linear style of tarantino s previous efforts   an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives    and there aren t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around    there s a samuel l   jackson monologue about guns   a jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk   and a jackson robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction   but that s about it    jackie brown s lone   innovation   is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives    this isn t exactly an original technique   it has been done numerous times before   most famously in akira kurosawa s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick s courage under fire    however   while in those two movies   and others     there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points of  view   tarantino s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it s unconventional    had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages   nothing would have been lost    as a result   this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity    for the second picture in a row   tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a  70s icon    this time around   instead of john travolta   it s blaxploitation queen pam grier   foxy brown has become jackie brown      in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier s career   tarantino uses a  70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits    there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre   although grier never does any butt kicking      grier is jackie brown   a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states    she s working for gun dealer ordell robbie   samuel l   jackson     but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning   despite pressure from ray nicolet   michael keaton     a federal official    no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie   ordell arranges for a bail bondsman   max cherry   robert forster   tv s   banyon     to post the necessary  10   000   then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal    jackie passes ordell s test   however   and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle  500   000 of ordell s money into the united states without tipping off the feds    soon   just about everyone is after that money   including jackie   max   ray   ordell s perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend   melanie   bridget fonda     and his right hand man   louis   robert de niro      unsurprisingly   the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l   jackson   but ordell isn t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction    in addition to looking fantastic   pam grier is also quite good   although hers is not an oscar  caliber performance   although she might get a nomination      robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough guys who rarely  smile roles    bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons   to look sexy in a bikini   to provide a little twisted comedy   and to satisfy tarantino s foot fetish    robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy  looking   middle aged actor    the film   which clocks in at several minutes over the two and a  half hour mark   is probably too long for the material   but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout   although the payoff is a letdown      tarantino keeps things moving along nicely   with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction   but   on the whole   this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself    when it comes to recent caper films   like the grifters and bound     jackie brown is a second tier effort    it s an entertaining diversion   but not a masterpiece   and certainly not an oscar contender    
1109	1	is evil dead ii a bad movie    it s full of terrible acting   pointless violence   and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release    explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots   including the original evil dead   is extremely difficult     well what s it about       five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly   hairy   wart covered monsters       come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week    why should i see it again       no evil dead ii is different   it s funny       it s funny to see people die    are you sick or something      maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie    his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle   as disturbing as it is hilarious    an example of raimi s odd approach   a monster   formerly protagonist ash s girlfriend of all people   is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound    sure it s over the top   but it is so over the top that it is laugh out loud funny   just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood   staining his face and knocking him back a few feet    the whole movie is like this   watch ash get beat up   watch ash defeat the monster   watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster    the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets   the more amusing it becomes    no matter how sick it may sound   it is funny to watch bruce ampbell s ash get his butt kicked every five minutes    and raimi takes advantage   he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend   by the body of an old lady   even by his own right hand    like the less superior idle hands   we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part    but it doesn t end   ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family    all of these events   thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster  like camera movements   at first become shocking   then inexplicably funny    raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses   he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers  duck soup   then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off    with a running time of less than an hour and a half   raimi gets away with the impossible   making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares    ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series   raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn t wait to make it s sequel

767	0	it seems that i ve stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch    take payback   for example   a movie that most people seem to like    however   it s horrible schlock   straight out of hollywood s vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies    it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better   however   maybe he did do better   after all   30 percent of the movie isn t his own    mel gibson   that hollywood zombie   decided he didn t like the ending and had another director reshoot it    what a crock    if you sign on to do a movie   then do it the way the script calls for    why film a movie and then look at it later and say     no   i changed my mind   i don t like the ending    you re fired    let s get someone else to do it      i suppose honor is dead in hollywood    the end of the film is   of course   hollywoodized    which is to say that it s happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize    in this case   as is most victories in hollywood movies   gibson s prize is a blond and money    i miss originality in film   i really do    i think audiences are so starved for it that they ll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original    payback s tagline   get ready to root for the bad guy   promised an original idea   but it was far from the truth    while gibson s character certainly broke the law   he was a character that had honor   odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it     wouldn t kill in front of children and protects his blond woman    there s nothing bad about him   he s a hollywood character   a person who could never exist in real life    and gibson knows it   he spends his time trying to act like a   bad guy     and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant    the story involves gibson being double crossed by his partner   who is a real bad guy   which made me wish that we could root for him   over  70   000    gibson recovers from multiple gunshots   is pissed   naturally     and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back   no more   no less    he makes a point of it that it s strictly 70 grand    a real bad guy would have made his ex partner pay 25  interest    this idea is completely stretched out    gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with    what i didn t understand   this is the chicago mafia     70   000 is like spare change to them    they d probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him    i think they d respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple  70   000    maybe i m being too hard on the movie    perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie    i read roger ebert s review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy    that s why we re allowed to root for him    and it s true   gibson walks the movie as if he s smiling at a joke he just heard    but he s wrong here    i wanted a lee marvin or old time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn t a comic   just an ass kicker    as a side note   i ve just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback    after this many reviews   why would anyone want to read this    really   i don t care    i m just trying to gain membership into the on line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can    
426	0	it s time to take cover    after a hiatus of about fifteen years   the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest    in early 1997   there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone   one on television and two in the theaters   with dante s peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar    of the two   i had heard that dante s peak was the better film   so i decided to check it out when it was released on video    the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town    the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption    flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky   crushing homes and people    we see people panicking   people crying   and even horses rearing    it is a disaster of biblical proportions   signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road    symbolism doesn t get much more blatant than that    we learn that harry dalton   pierce brosnan     a volcanologist with the u   s   geological survey   was there with his wife when the eruption occurred    harry survived   but his wife did not    a few years later   harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante s peak   washington   which   we are told   has been voted second most desirable place to live   under 20   000   by the readers of money magazine      there harry meets rachel wando   a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante s peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop    although the mayor doesn t seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up   a few members of the city council are    they are afraid that harry s presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante s peak    they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug    however   when an amorous young couple takes a skinny dip in the local hot springs   they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath    thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption    this film contains a number of cliches    the amorous couple is one    as soon as they doff their clothes   you know they re going to die    the town busybody and the abrasive mother in law make appearances   as does the death defying dog    countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable    watching the movie   i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements   but some of the dialogue as well    unfortunate   since much of the dialog is terrible    for example   harry s boss   paul   charles hallahan     and a team from the u   s   geological survey join harry to assess the situation    paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry s eruption predictions aren t cause for alarm    this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage   only to turn up the next day   ready for work    when paul asks harry why he stayed   he says with grim determination     cause this town s in trouble and i m the best man you ve got      even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving    he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water    if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up   however   the frog won t move and will allow itself to be cooked       is that your recipe for frog soup      asks one of the team members       it s my recipe for disaster     responds harry    dante s peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious    our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid    mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming   in a very grave tone     acid eats metal      thanks for the tip    when we first see the u   s   geological survey building   there s a caption labeling it as such    this wouldn t have been so bad if it weren t for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads   in large letters     u   s   geological survey      i suppose the caption is for people who can t read signs    although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film   the viewer has no idea why    there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters   and the relationship seems rushed because of this    when they get close to kissing   i was asking myself     why do they want to kiss    were they even attracted to each other      if i were the mayor   i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn t even crack a smile through the whole movie   trying to pull off the rough yet debonair act    who does he think he is    james bond    the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed    there are several   warning signs   prior to the eruption itself   but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don t feel as if they are leading up to anything    for example   one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot    a tremor occurs    does he plunge headlong to his death    is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below    no   a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg    the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene   which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well    it wasn t    one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante s peak    in a disaster movie   there s usually one guy who s greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption fire earthquake explosion tsunami tornado meteorite   and usually gets killed by the disaster    it s okay   of course   because we all think he got what he deserved    if you re going to be unoriginal   you might as well go all the way    in dante s peak   the city councilmembers are concerned   but they don t really try hard enough    maybe the mayor s abrasive mother in law should have been the one    for no apparent reason   she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt    perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate    there are a couple of good things about this movie    the first is the scenery    there are panoramic shots of forests   lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful    the second is the special effects    they are the closest i ve ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption    but when elements which don t speak are going to be the best parts of your movie   you d probably better rewrite the script    
1624	1	did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet    or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra terrestrial    i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher   ms   carey    but after seeing this movie   they may have confirmed my suspicions    as the story goes   at any time   there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth    the men in black   mib   are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens   guardians of our beloved planet from nasty tempered aliens   and secret service to the stars    based in new york city   where weird is the norm     the mib organization gives human form to our space faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed    but to enforce the laws of earth   the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast    they carry other worldly technology to erase people s short term memory when common folk see the mib in action    and their best leads on cosmic things gone awry are the supermarket tabloids    little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v   evil going on in the depths of space    one of the aliens as human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious    it holds the  key    literally   to universal peace    a giant cockroach like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this  key     in the wrong alien hands   flippers    mandibles    tentacles       it can be used as a weapon    therefore   it must be recovered and returned to it s rightful owners    otherwise   to ensure universal safety   earth will be destroyed   along with the  key     now   it s the mib who must prevent this catastrophe    the mib agents on the case are   k     played by tommy lee jones    he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore    the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes    he is accompanied by a flippant rookie     j     played by will smith    but   despite this shoot em up   protect earth from destruction premise   this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie    and   this isn t an independence day knockoff    rather   this is a stylishly offbeat sci fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies   that there are real aliens that live here   and that the government does its darndest to cover them up    but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe   there must be some kind of earth hangs in the balance scenario    yet   this movie is very appealing    the abundance of wierdness   talking aliens   pee wee atomizers   a mortician who  lives  for her work   and lots of yucky bugs and slime splattering galore     is played straight   like as if this were normal   of course   we are in nyc      it gives it a deadpan feel   which makes it all the more funnier and odder    jones plays the venerable seen it all agent with seriousness and maturity    smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones  straight man routine    they click like dorothy s ruby red shoes    the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld   the addam s family      this guy has a knack for  gothic  comedy   and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen    and   an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors    the story moves well   and before you know it   the end credits are already rolling    the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs   aaaahhhs and wows    let the men in black protect and color your world    
1455	1	i was pleasantly surprised by this film    with a budget topping  200 million   i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see    how much could you dress up the sets    how many models and computer effects could you use    how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks    oh   if i ve just given away part of the plot for you   go back to school    after having viewed titanic   however   i found it to be a well paced   well designed   and overall well made movie    there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic   but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i ve seen    titanic tells its story in two time periods    it starts out in the present   when ocean explorer brock lovett   bill paxton   and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic   searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship    what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace   which is broadcast on the news    the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett   who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas    there she tells her story to lovett and his team    in 1912   rose dewitt bukater   kate winslett     a young lady belonging to society s upper class   boards the titanic for the ship s first atlantic crossing   from southampton   england to new york    she is engaged to cal hockley   billy zane     an heir to old money   and a snob in every sense of the word    on board   rose feels the stifling trappings of high society s expectations   and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic s stern   but is saved from her self proclaimed fate by jack dawson   leonardo dicaprio     a passenger in third class     steerage     as it s referred to     who talks her out of jumping    although for rose the attraction is not immediate   a love affair soon develops between the two   which endangers rose s social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal    the story sounds very simple   and perhaps even unexciting   but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron   a good movie comes through    dicaprio is marvelous as the young   but worldly wise jack   playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors    his is a character that is immediately likable   as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations    girls are going to swoon over him    winslet also proves herself a good actress   delivering her lines convincingly   and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable    the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character s upbringing    simply by judgment of her gait   i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper crust debutante    rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess   she sometimes looks positively clumsy   and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting    billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal   since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him    his features are such that even when he smiles   there s something mistrustful about him   and when he scowls   he is evil incarnate    he s something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher   but a cheaper model    like dicaprio and winslet   zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well    backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy   cal s personal assistant   or   man   as they said at the turn of the century      no matter who else is in the cast   you can always count on a good performance by warner   who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match    additionally   there are a number of smaller fictional and non fictional roles thrown in for color   such as kathy bates as   the unsinkable   molly brown   danny nucci as jack s friend fabrizio de rossi   eric braeden as john jacob astor   and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie    nice to see dr   bombay getting work    also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die    this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic   but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship s crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else    in this way   titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures    you don t just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop   but a very real account of class struggle as well    as i mentioned before   the budget for this film was tremendous   and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects    the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail   and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic    with regard to the exteriors   i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale    cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank   but only had room for 90    and therefore had to computer generate the remaining 40 feet    could ve fooled me and everyone else in the theater   as the splicing is seamless    also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning    we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship   how the flooding occurred   the way the ship sank   and why it did so in that manner    these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening   and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction   in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion    in all   james cameron s titanic is a good blend of love story   history   and action    the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer s attention is held alternately by those three main elements   from the movie s intriguing beginning to it s satisfactory ending    in box office receipts   titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship

91 minutes    rated r   stars    had   hedwig and the angry inch   came out in the  70s   right after david bowie s   ziggy stardust     it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time    released in the 500 channel   sensory overload world of 2001   however   the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed off broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention    i almost missed it    every august   the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once    i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like   summer catch   and   bubble boy   that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run    but an e mail from a reader asking why i hadn t reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater    thank goodness for readers like him       hedwig and the angry inch   is a gender bending glam rock spectacular packed with great songs    stylistically   the hook laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie     bat out of hell   era meatloaf and   the rocky horror show     without ever seeming like imitations    as with   tommy       hedwig   tells a story of isolation   pain and defiance   but without the bloated feel of that beloved   but overrated rock opera    writer director star john cameron mitchell and composer lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner    mitchell stars as hedwig   a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u   s   coffee shops with her pan slavic band   the angry inch    while the patrons of the run down restaurants look on in shock   and sometimes horror   hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song    she was once a boy named hansel   ben mayer goodman     living with his mother   alberta watson   and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio    life is an exercise in duality for hansel    a wall splits his hometown into two parts    mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half    as hansel grows up   the duality becomes more pronounced    after initially mistaking him for a girl   a gi from the states   maurice dean wint   falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him    alas   hansel will never pass the mandatory physical    mother helpfully suggests a sex change   but the operation goes bad   hence the references to   the angry inch     yes   i know this part is squirm inducing   but stick with me   it s worth it      several years later   mr   right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig   decked out in a farrah fawcett style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women    hedwig finds a new love in tommy   michael pitt     a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity    but tommy does hedwig wrong   stealing her songs and becoming a superstar    cut to the present    tommy gnosis  stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him    despite warnings from her manager   andrea martin   that she could easily be labeled a stalker   hegwig and her new band   the angry inch   continue their coffee shop tour   shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in    if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical   take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of   tommy   and   rocky horror      as hedwig   john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being    mitchell has world class style and vocal chords to match    even though the backstory is unusually strong   mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical    everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and   trust me   these are full fledged rock songs   not the over processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals    while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film   there is much of interest on the sidelines    miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak   hedwig s lover and bandmate   conveying a great deal through expressions alone    decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard   she makes a mighty attractive man    as always     sctv   veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy   the angelic appearing little rat    artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical       hedwig and the angry inch   surrounds a weird   funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast    true originals do not come along very often   don t let this slip out of town without seeing it

1435	1	quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers    after his pulp fiction   many actors began receiving many offers for jobs    john travolta made his come back and is now one of today s most bankable stars    bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor    jackie brown   on the other hand   boasts quite a well known cast   except for the main lead   pam grier    most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films   but she s never really had a breakthrough performance   her first film was in the roger ebert written beyond the valley of the dolls      that is   until now    jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino   whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction    after mediocre acting jobs   tarantino returns to what made his name a household one   directing and writing    jackie brown is the result   and it is fantastic entertainment    despite excellent direction from tarantino   the cast steals the film   giving one good performance after another    pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown   and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent  samuel l   jackson   bridget fonda   michael keaton   robert de niro   and robert forster    more than likely   you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations    describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult   as you really can t say much or you spoil it for everyone else    i will tread lightly    jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown   grier   in a blue outfit walking through the airport    the camera tracks along with her   and ends up revealing her occupation    we are also introduced to ordell robbie   jackson     who sells illegal guns to interested buyers        for a hefty price    ms   brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away    however   an fbi agent   keaton   and a local l   a   cop   michael bowen   are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money    they try to reach him through beaumont livingston   chris tucker     one of ordell s buyers   but he mysteriously ends up dead    they try again through brown   but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong doing    but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell s friends   fonda     she is caught and sent to jail    ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent   max cherry   forster     and then wants to find out what she told the cops    after she claims to have said nothing   she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison    ordell doesn t like this   but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track    this scheme seems to be going as planned   but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal    revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown   and that s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film    tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments   and slang terms     but they are always done very well and believably    his hitmen are normally cruel   but pleasant   in that nasty sort of way    they talk like normal people   except for when doing business   and they are rude to their girlfriends    of course   this is a tarantino film   and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise    and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop    of course   tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film   adding a lot of his reservoir dogs style storytelling to it    things are told from one person s perspective   and then from another   and then from another   each time learning more and more    this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion   which decides who is on whose side    on the technical side of jackie brown   quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film    however   this time around it isn t as nearly as impressive or original    the writing   on the other hand   is quite good   although i do find tarantino s use of slang terms offensive    the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction   but it s much more easy to understand    his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation   but jackie brown is very simply to follow   especially considering that the time is given during the   leaps   in time    perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel   rum punch   by elmore leonard    the dialogue is pretty much intelligent   and all the characters are fully realized    the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro   who has worked with tarantino on previous films   and the editing is very good    and as with pulp fiction   the music is a highlight   bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s    the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable    the performances are incredibly rich   with hidden meaning behind every characters  actions    nothing is quite as it seems   and you can t really tell which side one person is on    the real treat   of course   is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown    her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits   which play an important role in the film    watching grieg   i could tell what was going through her mind   even if i didn t know what she was thinking    her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad   happy   or in deep thought    bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato    i didn t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits   her performance actually reminded me of heather graham s in boogie nights      michael keaton comes across very well   as does michael bowen    chris tucker has a small   but effective performance    samuel l   jackson is very good   but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction   although much less cynical      but no matter        jackson is very strong in his role    robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times   but overall he does a good job as one of ordell s perspective clients and friends    robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film   as he has one of the most developed characters    he is present throughout most of the film   and he holds his own against jackson and grier    jackie brown is rated r for language   sex   violence   drug use   and some offensive remarks    as a film by itself   jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment   with a complex plot to draw viewers in    however   one can not help but compare it to tarantino s pulp fiction   and expect great results    when compared   it comes up short   but not that short    it s a worthy effort   with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino    perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress    i can t remember seeing her in anything   except for a small role in mars attacks       but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one    expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations   and hopefully she will even be able to nab one      
174	0	watching the movie   i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup   cute  n cuddly   computer generated monkey    if the monkey died   the movie got an extra half star    alas   the monkey showed up at the end   unharmed   to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs    what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars    that s pretty generous   considering the movie s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek    when will robinson   jack johnson   teaches his pet robot about friendship   you are actually supposed to buy it    so why such a seemingly high rating    there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage    first   we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater    the sound and screen kicked ass    nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did   and i don t necessarily mean that in a good way      also   there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons   or getting caught up in the movie s tension    i even liked the computer generated settings    i usually prefer to see models or sets   but the cg was more detailed than i ve seen in a lot of movies   it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities    also   gary oldman is never a bad actor   even though he is typecast as a villain    william hurt isn t too bad either    neither actor had a great role   but their performances were watchable    and perhaps i shouldn t admit this   but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood    there is very little swearing or blood   there is a strong moral message   saccharine though it is   there is a bit of romance   whose culmination after 2 hours is a   real   kiss    no sex      it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six    those movies were probably as bad as lost in space   but at the time   they were manna from heaven    that type of moviemaking is a lost art    now for the bad news    worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue    it s squeaky clean   family fun   trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction       you better hold on to your joystick     is one such line    and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs   they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign    second worst   and closely related   is the screenplay    the story s exposition takes place at a press conference   which allows the writers to explain what s happening with the least amount of creativity   effort   or interest    once the story gets going   i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while   but on the whole   the situations that arise are silly and contrived    when gary oldman easily reprograms will s pet robot to kill the robinsons   my friend summed it up perfectly     he flipped the switch to  evil        then there s the tone of the movie    the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson    then it could be an adventure movie    they re mostly right   except that johnson   will   wasn t a good enough actor to carry it off    still   that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination    just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn t mean that we have to bow to a   promise keepers   notion of who s the center of a family    many quality family films have been made with a non traditional family structure   fly away home comes to mind   to much better effect    and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie    in star wars   the rebels were the good guys    we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system    in lost in space   the rebels are the bad guys   a terrorist force that must be killed   crushed and silenced so that our children may live free    that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists    finally   a few specific details deserve criticism    the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056    why    why bother saying what year this is    just tell us it s the future    i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997    setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won t be timeless   not that this movie was really in the running anyway        then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole    this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny s barber chair   and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven t learned a thing about ergonomics    one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed   it made lost in space look cool    the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and   out of context   made it sound hip    this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie    but if that s the best part of the movie   i can t in good conscience recommend it    still   if you get stuck seeing it   as we did   you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance   think of liking bad movies as a child   and bring along your   bad movie bingo   cards    
1831	1	albert brooks saves the day   just in the nick of time    with a very poor summer for movies   brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up   and does so in a positive way    while this may not be his finest work     the muse   still shakes up some delightful humor    in albert brook s latest comedy   he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter   brooks   who s losing his edge   as his business partners say    in desperation   he goes to see his friend jack   jeff bridges     who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past    he asks jack for some help   and recieves word of a real life muse   that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career    so brooks seeks the muse named sarah   sharon stone     and is suckered into buying her expensive   food etc   as a sort of payment    the real punch line however   doesn t come until the end    it really makes you wonder   how screenwriters really get their ideas   could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street    the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner    speaking of brooks   he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter    every time he graces the screen   i can t help but start laughing    albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character    the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone    she wasn t likeable at all    brooks had the right idea with her occupation   but she never pulled through    in a way   she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak    luckily brooks could clean up the mess   and cover for stone s mishap    it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance   because   the muse   had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy    on a brighter note   andie macdowell was also charming as brook s wife    she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress   because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she s in    the funniest moments in   the muse   in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese    i mean imagine   brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice   like it was something out of the ordinary    it was just plain hilarious    it just adds to the satire joke   of how directors get ideas    brilliant move by brooks    as i mentioned before   the film is a satire much like it s proceeder bowfinger   which came out a few weeks before    unlike bowfinger   this is not a mean spirited film that s desperate for jokes   it s rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood       bowfinger   had it s moments   but had quite a few problems that were never worked out   but   the muse   still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour    by the end of the film   you re glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it    for once i m not fully disappointed   because the film didn t slow down   it kept moving   even with some flaws    thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort    i think he ll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future

story seem new       the wrong trousers     for example   pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks   and   a close shave   owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories    but in the hands of park and his team   the stories felt fresh and inspired   and not the least bit contrived    now teaming with co director peter lord   park has created a similar creature in   chicken run      the plot is largely lifted from   the great escape     watch for a quick reference to the ball bouncing scene     with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement    thing is   the film doesn t feel like it s been lifted from somewhere else     chicken run   feels fresh   alive   like nothing else ever done    part of it is the original idea   who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners of war movie starring chickens    park and lord milk the incongruity for all it s worth   the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious   and to them   it is    but they re   chickens     so it s funny to us    another thing that helps   chicken run     and most of park s films   succeed is the animators  subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing    there are references to   the great escape     obviously   and   stalag 17      the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both   raiders of the lost ark   and   indiana jones and the temple of doom      there s even a nod to   the blues brothers     if you can believe it   and the filmmakers even get in a little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor   taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson s nationality and film history    the   braveheart   reference is a hoot if you catch it    when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one     chicken run   is downright brilliant in its execution    consider this   since july of last year   i ve seen dozens upon dozens of   blair witch project   parodies   on television   on the radio   and online    out of all those   maybe one or two were amusing   the rest tiresome    why    because once you got past the thought that   they re parodying that  blair witch  movie     most of the parodies had nothing to offer    no insight   no original idea   no greater purpose    they were only funny if you had seen the movie   otherwise   you got nothing    conversely     chicken run   doesn t lean on its parodies    the film references are never the sole focus of any scene    if you ve never seen   indiana jones     the chase sequence is still fun    even if you have no idea who mel gibson is   rocky remains an interesting character    park   lord   and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it s understood   and as a result     chicken run   is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious   but not quite vague either    enjoyment of this movie doesn t require knowledge of film history   but if you ve got it     chicken run   is that much richer    the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances   and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it s hard not to fall in love with every one of them    ginger is perfect   spunky and opinionated   but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind   and julia sawalha   known as the cute mousy girl on   absolutely fabulous     nails it    she has warm   human chemistry with gibson   whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung ho veneer    the characters  inevitable romance doesn t feel contrived   but sweet    poor mr   tweedy   tony haygarth   suspects the chickens are organizing in some way   but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out   and his overbearing wife certainly isn t any help    jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs   a hen that runs away with most of the best one liners   all while perpetually crocheting a sweater     and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence    they even come up with an inspired riff on something that s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades   the chicken vs   egg dilemma    one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome   but as with most of   chicken run     it comes as a delightful surprise    the film manages to cross all barriers   it should be accessible to both children and adults   brits and yanks   rats and chickens    the animation is first rate    remember that this was all done the old fashioned way   with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit   and you see just how truly remarkable   chicken run   really is    this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios  animation great   precise and unwavering attention to detail    as in such top notch family fare as   a bug s life   or   toy story 2       chicken run   has something to offer in nearly every frame    certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes   but a active   attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details    anyway   the movie s just a boatload of fun    funnest damn movie i ve seen all year    
1262	1	   a breed apart   casts rutger hauer as a crazy   bird loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner    a bit hard to swallow    that s only the first of many improbabilities in this film    hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe   while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector    turner is the woman caught between the two men       a breed apart   isn t a bad movie   exactly    indeed   i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters   even though their goals couldn t be more different    the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies    for example   early on in the film   hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at   his   birds    later on   the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people   and hauer kills a few of them    i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn t get involved at that point    another problem is the silly love triangle that develops    i didn t care one way or the other who ended up with turner    i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions    however   despite this uninteresting sub plot   turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there s more to life than money and birds    as for hauer   he s an actor i ve always admired    he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters    and this one is no exception    he s frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse   wearing pirate s clothing   and holstering a cross bow    despite all his eccentric mannerisms   though   hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through    for example   there s a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early    he comes off as crazy loner in that scene   but a few minutes later   he is apologizing to turner   and we believe his intentions    soon after   we find out he s a vietnam vet   and his actions become fairly clear to us       a breed apart   isn t a great movie by any means   but it does contain good performances by all three leads   and it s worth seeing for that reason alone    
1416	1	jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation    even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited   the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation    this is   after all   the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction    to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood   since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio   desperado   four rooms   and from dusk  til dawn    he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide       i m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him      tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films   but never took the director s helm    nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more   tarantino returns with a film he can call his own    the film opens up with an homage to the graduate   with jackie brown   pam grier   on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her    jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo   which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas    this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi   samuel l   jackson   who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico    however   while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u   s   for ordell   jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus   michael bowen   and atf agent ray nicolet   michael keaton     who catch her not only with the money   but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs    jackie didn t know they were in the package with the cash   but that s of no consequence to the authorities   who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted    of course   dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish   ordell    ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry   robert forster   to get jackie out of jail   but while max is immediately attracted to her   jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety   since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police    sure enough   ordell shows up at jackie s apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good   but she   borrows   max s pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell    instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol s chamber to ordell s head   jackie proposes a deal    since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico   jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more   but this time for a more substantial fee   fifteen percent of ordell s half million dollars    with a gun in his face   how can ordell not agree    by itself   this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film    however   we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think    jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell   but she s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max    the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham   but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around    instead   it s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today s movies    at least this film has a little imagination    most of the performances in jackie brown are above par    pam grier   of whom i had never taken notice before   plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable    samuel l   jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control    robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy   trying to do his best      never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course    he s just so down to earth   the nature of his job really doesn t occur to us   even when we re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison   or when we see the tools of his trade    in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara   a recently paroled friend of ordell s   and bridget fonda as melanie   one of the girls ordell keeps around town    unfortunately   de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between   and then they are mostly clipped sentences    in this film   he s not really de niro   but stereotypical de niro   uttering things like     little bit     and   pretty much      fonda   on the other hand   plays the slightly spaced out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness   such that even when she is annoying louis   we are taking her side    as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand   the dialog is quick and snappy    it grabs our attention and is actually interesting   and in many respects   this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals   the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves    don t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera   however    there s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange   and he s not really sure what s happening   but by composing the scene just so   his realization of what s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience    we look at the screen and think     gee   that s clever     and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on    although tarantino isn t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect   it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film    there are shots where a character is simply driving   and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head    this is a tribute to both direction and acting    however   there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall   and she is looking for something   desperately looking for something    we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search   but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she s looking for   but instead hoping she ll just stop    overall   viewing jackie brown is time spent well    some flap has already been made about the language used in the film   but it s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today    in fact   one might even be able to say that the way in which these   offensive   words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness    go see the film and see what i mean    
109	0	       the following review contains spoilers           it s just        the way        we are          a rapist   matt frewer   responds to supergirl s   helen slater   query as to why she s being attacked   an example of the mind numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl    i ll admit it        i love superman iii    i know it s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor   but i still think it s a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise    supergirl   a spin off film of sorts from the series  same producers   alexander and ilya salkind     doesn t even rival superman iii in terms of quality   let alone superman or superman ii    supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time    as the film begins we see the residents of argo city   a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in   inner space     go about their daily lives    ok        what    so these are exiles from krypton   which blew up right    were they living there before krypton exploded    how do you get to   inner space      this whole   inner space   notion is never explained   particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world    how do they know where superman went    how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet    these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me    argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron    one day the founder of argo city   zaltar   peter o  toole     gives the omegahedron to superman s cousin   kara   helen slater     for use as inspiration in her art    kara uses it to create a bug like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of   whatever   that protects the city    in the chaos   the omegahedron sails out through the opening   dooming the argonians to death        in three days time   or something    kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world    the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor league witch named selena   faye dunaway   who   immediately before her dip was ruined   announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel   peter cook      selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans   and she sets out to achieve world domination    selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth   and that she s arrived as supergirl   complete with appropriate costume      supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives    ok        huh    why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake    attention movie   explain yourself    i m sorry   i can only suspend disbelief so much    i can t buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to    knowing that she needs a secret identity   supergirl basically   wills   herself into a school girl outfit   complete with a different hairstyle     picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school    she s given her dorm assignment   and who happens to be her roommate    lois lane s sister   lucy    ok   coincidence is one thing folks   but we re getting really contrived now    what follows are some generic all girls school hijinks        complete with evil bully girls   mean for no reason   of course   and even a shower scene          best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks    at this point i m rapidly wondering why i m bothering with this nonsense    there is some credit to give to the film however    one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an   evil   bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its   prey   is very well done    also   its commendable to see genders reversed in the film   whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools    hart bochner   die hard   is particularly fun as kara s love interest   a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena   although he is unfortunately part of one of the film s more ridiculous moments   when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some   menacing   bumper cars      then there were numerous little things that bothered me    the flying effects are never convincing for a moment        it s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires    instead of having her look like she s flying   the filmmakers wanted her to be   graceful     so she poses a lot and does ballet type maneuvers    also   who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth    a pair of truck drivers rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a   wacky   demise    there is also some rampant product placement in the film   most notably for popeye s   tylenol   and a w root beer   with the latter actually putting its logo on the t shirt of one of the rapists            finally   just one word   monsters    faye dunaway and peter o toole ham it up unmercifully   however when o toole overacts he s entertaining and when dunaway does it she s annoying   her character actually says the line   seize them      at one point      dunaway s henchmen   played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro   fare much better   with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty s otis character from the first two superman movies    helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent   naive character she s written to be   as she s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable    believability aside though   it s still annoying    now despite all this negativity   and i m not alone here       supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles     leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested   but excited about its release on dvd    they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd   to the delight of many people   including myself        yet i m still unclear as to why   since this movie is so awful      the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u   s   theaters    the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2   35   1   is enhanced for 16x9 televisions   and has been remastered in full thx glory    extras on the disc include   a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and   special project consultant   scott michael bosco   the excellent 50 minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl the making of a feature   dig that workout montage       5 trailers   3 tv spots   talent bios   in depth storyboards   accompanied by score from the movie     and assorted still galleries    the transfer on this international version is incredible        you d think you were watching a new release    images are sharp   colors jump off the screen   and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts    only some special effects sequences show the wear of time   and there just isn t much that can be done about that   unless you re obsessive like george lucas      the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places   however you ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score   which is completely unrelated to john williams  classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films  golan globus production      the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries    bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there s no dead air on the track    bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen   and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation    although   at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc   and is surprised when he doesn t get that response    we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track   most notably the   almost   appearance in the film by christopher reeve    great detail is given about superman s proposed role in the original script before reeve   wisely   dropped out    as it stands   superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission    for the sake of brevity   i won t even get into that one    szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds   and everyone else agreed   that supergirl needed to stand on its own   replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy   whimsical fantasy   nonsense    bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along   claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office    again   for the sake of brevity   i won t even get into that one    anchor bay has also released a limited edition   only 50   000 copies pressed   two disc set    disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release    disc two features the never before seen director s cut of the film   which runs 138 minutes long    the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don t add much of note   except for a few moments which lengthen peter o toole s screen time   particularly during his latter appearances      the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono   but fans of the film won t care    one question though        shouldn t the director s commentary be on the director s cut of the film    i d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd    i was nine when it was released to theaters   and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it    so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect    i knew the film wasn t beloved and i never had any interest in it before   but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc    as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence   which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong    come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo        so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started    at the end of the film   supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron   and flies back to argo city    ugh   i give up    i m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once   not twice   but three times to review these discs    supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package   but a very lousy movie     pg   
1029	1	the most common   and in many cases the only   complaint against francis ford coppola s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia   which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour   loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler   kinder ages    martin scorsese   another italoamerican moviemaker   confronted that perspective with his own   more down to earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets   movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime    unfortunately for scorsese   his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies    seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime    this film was goodfellas   epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s    goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story   told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi   who would co write the screenplay for the film      the book   as well as the film   chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill   played by ray liotta     irish italian criminal from new york    at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero   played by paul sorvino     local mob boss   and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands    after couple of years   together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito   played by joe pesci     he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway   played by robert de niro      three of them spend years as best friends and associates   gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history    wealth   influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen   played by lorraine bracco     who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities   domestic abuse   arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business    but the perfect world of   wiseguys   gradually begins to fall apart   tommy s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence   jimmy s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and   finally   henry s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends    goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory    scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker    world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating    scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence   hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime   yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny    after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history   based on some notorious real life events     the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths   trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens    scorsese also manages to break viewer s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material   scenes that depict personal tragedies   broken homes   human depravity   violence   bloodshed and murder   in all their uncompromising reality   but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience    with the use of ironic soundtrack   manipulative shots   character s dialogue or narrator s commentary   goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era    even if we don t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining   we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker    first   we might notice unusual structure of the plot   relatively minor subplot is used as movie s ironic prologue    then   instead of single narrator   scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards    this multiple points of views   both in terms of narration and various subjective shots   only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation    same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack    nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy listening 1950s pop songs   while depression   paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s    but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment   almost pastoral   easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed    however   thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people    such scenes   although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings   became very popular among other directors in 1990s    fragmentary character of the screenplay   which doesn t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes   gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese    he uses this structure of film to experiment   and most successful of such experiments is hilarious   a day in life   segment near the end of the film    another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents    the most respectable among them is robert de niro   but his character   who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio   gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues    joe pesci deserved his   oscar   for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy   and his lines   including ad libs   probably represent the most memorable element of the film    ray liotta   although equally talented   perhaps doesn t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film    liotta s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thugs    liotta   on the other hand   improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction    lorraine bracco is   on the other hand   very effective and believable as karen hill   wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband    paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso   and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave    as a combination of clever sociological study   black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do   work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time    because of this achievement   and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers   this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s    
1207	1	when i first heard of contact   the hype was building it up as a sci fi blockbuster    now   with that in mind   coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster s involvement in the project   i thought   what in the world is foster doing in a sci fi blockbuster            as it turned out   my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy turvy    robert zemeckis   back from the euphoria created by his last film   forrest gump   once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit    don t get me wrong   contact is sci fi   but with a definite difference    based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name   the story delves itself in questions on science and god   fact and faith    allie   foster   is a radio astronomer    she spends her time listening to the stars   via ultra huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system    her passion for  long distance communication  is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham radio system   a hobbyist radio communication device   which her late father bought for her    a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences  view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late mother through the ham radio system in which her father replied   not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that   now      allie s research is based on the seti project   search for extra terrestrial intelligence     in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation    her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government   which considers it a waste of taxpayer s money and politically unviable   her supervisor   tom skerritt   pulls the plug on seti    undaunted   allie managed to gather a loyal group of  believers  and eventually found funding from a large private corporation    the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day   she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound wave    the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers   cultist   the media and of course   the government    the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission    as the world join forces to build this transport   allie is desperate to be the one to go    she enrols herself among a few hopefuls   to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation    her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president s spiritual advisor   mcconaughey     allie   being an atheist   a result of her belief in fact and science   refuses to budge upon questioning    at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president s spiritual advisor    a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey    from the very first meeting scene   it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects   foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith   hope and the power of the unseen    the meeting of their worlds   added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless    many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous   but by actually immersing yourself in it   gives you an entirely different perspective   one which is free from bias and pre conceptions    zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film    contact works by not delving in controversy but rather   touches the thinking audience   urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith   whether one can actually find compromise within    i consider contact as one of the must sees for this year

1042	1	   he s back   and it s about time      was the motto for this television series pilot   i call it a pilot   i don t care what fox network says   revival of the cult classic british tv show   doctor who   that spawned no series   which means there are no smart network execs out there   not exactly news to a lot of people   i know      the motto was well chosen    the series was simple   it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies   including the evil daleks   and the master   who appears in this feature   played very badly by eric roberts    as good as this revival was   there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who    is it the acting    hell   no    paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who ve played the doctor   including his predecessor and off screen friend sylvester mccoy   who appears once more for the regeneration scene      he looks right for the role   is a brilliant actor   and slips effortlessly into the role   the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would    daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr   grace holloway   the doctor s first companion that he kisses on screen   she is not your typical female companion who screams   and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor   she is a tough   spunky american   and ashbrook shows this well    young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee   and i ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end   this film included     which   imho   wastes his talent    the only problem with the acting is eric roberts    one time he had to say to mcgann s doctor     i always dress for the occasion      but he broke it up   and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric     i always        dress        for the occasion      you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act   and who s also british   like mcgann is as the doctor    executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role    i dunno who thought of casting him   but if they re reading this   news flash   eric roberts is   not   a star    he rides on his sister s coattails   and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him    is this problem the kisses to the past    they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them   only whovians would   and they re good    is it the script or the movie as a whole    the script is a classy piece of work   featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue   and the movie as a whole is one fans will love   and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series    so what is it    simple   no plot    the master   on his last legs   sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him    the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey   but they accidentally land in san francisco   1999   december 31   where the master   with young street hood chang lee s help   opens the eye of harmony   which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor   with the help of female surgeon   dr   grace holloway   doesn t close it by then    virtually no plot    i was told the movie would ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks   but a lot of rewriting went on on the set    that shows how smart people are   as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting   and that would ve gotten a four star rating out of me

1161	1	with his last two films   shine and snow falling on cedars   australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there   and his latest   hearts in atlantis   is no different    its structure   beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle   is similar to the green mile   which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books    the parallels don t end there   either    atlantis was adapted by william goldman   who had previously penned the big screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king s dreamcatcher    even the film s content is a bit reminiscent of mile    in fact   it s the perfect blend of the feel good  60s nostalgia of stand by me   also by king   and mystical power hokum of mile    king s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories   but the main focus here is on the first   and longest   tale   called low men in yellow coats   the film s title comes from the second chapter      it s set in 1960 harwich   connecticut   where 11 year old bobby garfield   anton yelchin   lives in a boarding house run by his cold   self centered mother elizabeth   hope davis   joe gould s secret     who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son    bobby spends his time with his two closest friends   john sullivan   will rothhaar   and tomboy carol gerber   mika boorem     who become something like the kevin   paul and winnie of harwich    when a new tenant moves into the vacant room   the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan   anthony hopkins   hannibal     a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror    ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature   after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday     dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men   a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers    i won t go into what these powers are   but they re considerably toned down from the book   and don t involve black stuff flying out of ted s mouth   a la mile      atlantis  present day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel s final chapter   titled heavenly shades of night are falling   and features david morse   in yet another connection to the green mile   as a married   middle aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years    atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks  cedars   which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski   the oscar nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski s red    the acting is solid from everyone   including hopkins   who never once makes you think of dr   lecter    most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem   who both had tiny parts in along came a spider    while i didn t really have much of a problem with goldman s screenplay   i do need to point out at least one inconsistency    goldman   for those of you who don t read premiere   writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else s films   carefully explaining why they all suck   make no sense and insult their audiences   while somehow failing to mention the crap that he s penned   like the general s daughter      it s mean spirited but fun to read   mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business   including michael jackson   o   j    and robert blake      in atlantis   which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby   one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back    well   he s not   and it doesn t make sense    1   41   pg 13 for violence and thematic elements

40	0	capsule   where are you tonight   leni rienfenstal    starship troopers is an expensive   hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography    and bad pornography   at that    it is not good cinema   not good storytelling   and not even stupid fun   it s so cynically   calculatedly bone headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed    it s one of the worst movies i ve seen in a long time    why am i calling this movie pornography    pornography   in the abstract   is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts    i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie   where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper   as   a near pornographic eternity      i didn t agree with that assessment   but i could see what was being implied   the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout   do  er   man   do  er      that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers    it s   literally   like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk    it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening    the film takes place in our future   when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn t appear to have intelligence    to counterattack   humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable   instead of nuke the planet from orbit   which they re clearly capable of   they send down grunts with m 16 rifles    this isn t heinlein   it s a bad wwii movie   one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy   repetitive   and ultimately tiresome       one scene has a journalist on a battlefield   filimg soldiers being slaughtered   and ends with groaning predictability   said cameraman gets skewered   too      the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic    they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense    they don t even behave like soldiers in a bad   movie     and therefore we don t care about them    we hated the tom berenger character in platoon   but he   mattered     and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate    here   we don t even hate the bugs    what s there to hate    hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine    if there s anything really hateful there   the movie doesn t know how to give it to us    the screenwriter   ed neumeier    perhaps a better appelation would be   screen typist     and director   the increasingly talent impaired paul verhoeven   have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other    one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who s great at getting out of tight situations   and does it again and again and again    once or twice is fine    by the fifth or sixth time   it s worn out its welcome    there s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything   or really being tested to show their mettle    also   the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry    if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp   then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing    but if one human gets cornered   he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip    uh huh    the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi fascist flavor    i say   quasi    because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action    the gear   the uniforms   etc      the movie doesn t have the nerve   or the brains   to be genuinely fascist   or intelligent about the subject    the bumpers between scenes   which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda    just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison    like the rest of the movie    there s more   i suppose   but it s not worth it    the acting is bland   neither arsenic nor gravy   the music disposable   the camerawork turgid    the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece

1711	1	some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled   making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen    i finished mike figgis    leaving las vegas   hours ago   and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr    alot of people refer to this film as   that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude         leaving las vegas   is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are   a drunk and a whore    ben   nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years   is the drunk    his family and friends have long since abandon him   and all he has left is his liquor    in a scene early in the film   we see ben staggering into a resteraunt   looking for a   friend   of his to mooch some money off of    he finds the guy   richard lewis   having dinner with a buddy and two chicks   trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid    when ben approaches the table   you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable    after lewis gives ben the money   he coldly says   i think it would be best if you didn t contact me again      now even though through the course of the film   some much more depressing things happen   this is when i felt the most for ben    there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face     not to sound hokey or anything   it almost brought a tear to my eye    it turns out that ben was once a semi successful hollywood player   and apparently a pretty popular guy    now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women   not so much for the sex   but for the company   for someone to talk to or spend time with    once he is fired from his job   ben decides to burn all his belongings   collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death    one night he runs into a prostitute   a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue   how far she has come since   adventures in babysitting     named sera    she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp   a scumbag who gets off by cutting her    they are both very lonely   self destructive people    they immediatly hit it off   both of them realizing that they need one another    and it isn t even a sexual relationship    they don t even have sex until   like   the last ten minutes of the film       leaving las vegas   is not a film about plot    with the exception of what i have already revealed   which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so   by the way     there isn t too much of a story to it    it is more a film about people and how they react to one another    from what i can see   this is basically a perfect film    the direction is great   with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody   smokey atmosphere of a film noir   and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s   or any other decade for that matter    but don t go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you re getting yourself into    first off   if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge   stay away from   leaving las vegas      it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms   rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon   that s right      secondly   if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film   don t see it    however   if you are cool with those two things   you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have

80	0	   virus   is the type of cliched   vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it    strangely enough   on the same mid january weekend last year   another film was released like this     deep rising     about an ugly monster on a cruise liner    prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989 s   leviathan     1989 s   deep star six     and all four   alien   pictures       virus     in comparison   is a servicable thriller   well made and produced   but since it doesn t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence   it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on    based on a series of comic books     virus   concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat   which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon    after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking     un   lucky for them   a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen    once the team reaches the russian ship   they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted    after turning the power back on   however   there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship   and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself    one survivor finally does turn up   nadia   joanna pacula     who informs the suicidal and stern captain   donald sutherland   and one of the crew   kit foster   jamie lee curtis     that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship   taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out    if   virus   sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies   you re correct    although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life   the film itself doesn t appear to have a brain in its head    the film sticks so close to the worn out conventions of the   creature   genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film    the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past   but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play    in her second return to horror in the last year   jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine   but that is about it    although 1998 s   halloween   h20   was also a disappointment   at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character   unlike here    donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films   such as 1994 s   the puppet masters     although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci fi classic   invasion of the body snatchers     where he was fabulous    the last of the three top billers is william baldwin   but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture   since he has nothing to do    basically     virus   is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship ocean liner haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one by one    it is not the worst of its type   but it is far from one of the best   and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this    as long as some of them keep making money   i suspect the answer is never

1091	1	robert benton has assembled a stellar   mature cast for his latest feature   twilight   a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood    paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross    harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames   gene hackman and susan sarandon     a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight    when jack sends him on a routine delivery job   however   the old instincts kick in    soon   harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line   and he no longer knows who to trust    there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight   in addition to newman   hackman and sarandon    james garner plays raymond hope   a former cop and one of harry s best friends    stockard channing plays verna   harry s former partner   and possibly a former love interest    reese witherspoon is mel   the distrustful daughter of the ames    and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend    giancarlo esposito appears as harry s bumbling detective protigi   and john spencer is a suspicious police captain    with a cast like that   it s almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze    luckily   there s more to the film than some sort of actor s recognition ceremony    twilight has a solid film noir ish plot    it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics   but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days    the major cast members all deliver strong performances   as can be expected of their caliber    however   none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable    the supporting cast is enjoyable   if a little underdrawn    stockard channing s character   in particular   is a cipher    there s more to her character than the film takes the time to describe    it s a minor   but irritating   flaw    with a solid cast   and a good plot   there s a lot to recommend about twilight    it s biggest flaw is actually its short running time    at a slim 94 minutes   there s a lot of stuff that s packed into an awfully small package    still   the chance to see newman   sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two

born killers is total and blatant    where bonnie   clyde was social   natural born killers is psychological    what bonnie   clyde hinted at   natural born killers confronts and explores    what bonnie and clyde stole   mickey and mallory kill    to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them   expressed metaphorically as killing   subdues the mysterious power this film wields    for the most part   when mickey and mallory kill   they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily   they kill what is trying to kill them   they kill what dissembles and cowers from life   they kill what needs to be killed    this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity    brahma created    vishnu preserved    and siva destroyed   but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma    the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate   i m forced to say it for clarity s sake   a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes   that is   destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics    your plumber   bonnie and clyde   mickey and mallory   and siva are all productive destroyers    i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death   presently and historically   than any other phenomena    muslims kill christians    hindus kill muslims    christians kill pagans    jews kill christians   etc   you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged    religion is an orgy of killing    the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn t been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable       the state is the divine idea upon earth     hegel said   meaning it is absolute   all powerful   ineffable   unassailable   infallible   authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh   allah   god   etc    well   what does all this have to do with natural born killers    let me first say that religions of this nature   in the ideal   take the place of sex    consider the catholic church   which in its hey dey   took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever    god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope   cardinals   bishops   monks   etc   they forego the one   in order to come closer to the other    during the middle ages   when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged   the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power       parenthetically   witness plato as well    in the republic   he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime    not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself   regularly assailing the passions      catholicism   as policy   attacks the passions as evil    it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure    masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution    this is religion   this is authoritarianism in its essence    as further evidence   the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters    our culture   most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years    we can t help but adopt   even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes   leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self    mickey and mallory knox internalized them   too   then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other   discovered them   and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves    it is a straightforward liberation through sex    as some good patriarch once observed     you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on      m m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions    they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions       the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers     as mickey says    as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter   let us look each other in the face    we are hyberboreans  we know well enough how remote our place is       neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans     even pindar   in his day   knew that much about us    beyond the north   beyond ice   beyond death  our life   our happiness          we have discovered that happiness   we know the way   we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth    who else has found it     the  man of today        i  don t know either the way out or the way in   i am whatever doesn t know either the way out or the way in     so sighs the man of today          this is the sort of modernity that made us ill  we sickened in lazy peace   cowardly compromise   the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay    this tolerance and largeur of the heart that   forgives   everything because it   understands   everything is a sirocco to us    rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south winds    as far as i can tell   this is what the movie has to say    its alleged critique of the media is only secondary   tertiary   quaternary   subsidiary for sure    for example wayne gayle s first report ends with some gen x dude saying     if i were a mass murderer i d be mickey and mallory     in his most excellent bill and ted voice    on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical   impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes    it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he d be just like them   killing and destroying what deserves it    let me exemplify what i ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film   namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant   kills him   and then castigates him for giving her   the worst fuckin  head i ve ever had in my life          now   i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship   because demonstrably they didn t   and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this    sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations   but unwilling to kill each other   since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation   they must kill in place of their lever    it s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey    as the attendant approached he took on mickey s character in the eyes of mallory    she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory    upon discovery   mallory views this as a betrayal   judges him   and commutes his sentence on someone else    the style of the movie is a whole  nother matter that i won t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power    let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness   barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle    the rapid succession of all those 8mm   16mm   35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish   frenetic mood    also   jungian archetypes abound    these can t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames    some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind     quotes are paraphrased only      mickey to mallory     one of these days i m gonna be cummin  for you     in prison   while mallory jacks mickey off    semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come    at the time they haven t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet    the two of course go hand in hand    for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs    mickey during his marriage to mallory     as creator of my universe   i pronounce us man and wife      the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting   but telling   too    it reveals m m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones    this is what mickey means by   creator of my universe     he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes    it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears    scagnetti s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant s mouth    the indian sage releasing mallory s father   who was reincarnated as a snake     old man   go be a snake     after telling his   snake story   that ends with   bitch   you knew i was a snake      after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare   mallory says     you killed life          this is another telling quote because it implies they didn t see themselves as killers of life    then what were they killing up to that time    in some case just those zombies faking their way through life   the living dead   as it were    in other cases   all the anti life forces   the cops and their parents    the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison    it of course symbolizes rebirth    dr   emil reingold   as portrayed by steven wright   passing judgement on m m     mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong   they just don t give a damn      this is reminiscent of nietzsche s whole philosophy   and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil    mickey     the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers      mickey   again in his interview       me and you   we are not the same species      notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control    mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang    the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader   no matter who it is    mickey   how ya feelin     wayne   fucking great    mickey   you got the feelin     wayne   i m alive    i m alive for the first fuckin  time    what an incredible transformation this is    he got the feeling and he couldn t contain himself    what a feeling    that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe    mickey when almost caught in a dead end     think   think   think   think      go figure it out    dwight   tommy lee jones   in general   because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film    his whole attitude can be summed up with     destroy them

1948	1	star wars   episode 1   the phantom menace   1999    review by matt pusateri  few movies evoke nostalgia   enthusiasm   and affection like george lucas  1977 classic   star wars    the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers   but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture    arguably   more americans today can explain what   the force   or a   jedi   is than a budget deficit or a serb    so 22 years after the release of the original   and 16 years since the third film   the return of the jedi   how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation    can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy   luke   han solo   and darth vader  all cultural icons    against this challenge   the fourth star wars film   episode one   the phantom menace hit the screens last week    and despite some early critical reviews in the major media   the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment    while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series   it is nonetheless engaging   exciting   and visually breathtaking    it is a worthy sequel   er   prequel   to the original star wars films    the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films    as the film opens   obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor     the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars   is only a young jedi apprentice   still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor   qui gon jinn   liam neeson      the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation    the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations   but in the middle of a planetary invasion   rushing to protect naboo s young queen amidala   natalie portman      later   after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo   they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice    on tatooine   qui gon discovers a young slave boy   anakin skywalker   jake lloyd     who not only can help them get the parts they need   but displays uncanny intelligence   insight   and instincts    qui gon senses the child is   unusually strong   with the force and begins to suspect that he may be   the one   prophesized to   bring balance to the force      as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows   far from being a galactic savior   the innocent looking 9 year old will in time become the ruthless darth vader    complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure   darth sidious   is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo   and sends out a lethal apprentice   darth maul   to find and capture queen amidala    while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet   they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul    if the plot sounds a bit complicated   it is    the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis   but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic   the demise of the jedi knights   anakin s turn to evil   and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy    but the complexity is not overwhelming    the story moves quickly   with the only drawback being that many questions   predictably   remain unanswered at the end of the film   setting the stage for the next episode    one of the reasons the film s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing   but too unfocused    it s unclear whose story phantom menace is    in the original trilogy   the movies were clearly luke s story   with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight    but it s unclear whether this new film is anakin s story or obi wan s    if this trilogy is centered on anakin   it s a shaky foundation    lloyd   like many child actors   lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers   and as a result   his character seems shallow and unimpressive    on screen   we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little boy face   or for that matter   any presence that would make him seem so special that qui gon is willing to believe he is   the one      the rest of the cast does fine   though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas    neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight    mcgregor is well cast as obi wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility    portman fits the role of a young queen well   but her lines were often very formal   giving her little room to give her character much personality    the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters   but the interaction between them    individually   the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars   and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series    but unlike the previous trilogy   lucas doesn t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another    in star wars   there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han   han and obi wan   and leia and luke    the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities    in the sequence in where luke   han   and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star   the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other    there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other    individually   they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests   but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them    this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film   and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers    but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction   the film is still very engaging    many of the wonderful elements of lucas  previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining    first   of course   is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates    the characters visit magical underwater cities   evade dinosaur sized sea monsters   fight battle droids and menacing   destroyers   on venetian looking planet of naboo   watch a spectacular event   part roman chariot race   part nascar circuit   on the arid desert planet of tatooine   then head to corsucant   the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council    each location is elaborate and complex    lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings   he creates rich   spectacular landscapes   palaces   and skylines    most of the new special effects in his re released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren t possible when the films were made    more than ever   in this new film   lucas  universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures   robots with personalities   and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters    the best such character is watto   a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves    watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short   paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room    of all the computer generated characters in the film   watto is the best done and most enjoyable    speaking of computer generated characters   no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film   jar jar binks    with more than 80 minutes of screen time   jar jar is the realization of george lucas  dream to include a fully computer generated character into the cast of the new trilogy    jar jar   a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race   literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon s accidental sidekick    jar jar usually performs a comic relief role in the film   lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble    the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless   and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors    however   despite the technological magic that makes his character possible   jar jar isn t completely convincing    he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene    throughout the movie   jar jar never transcends a   roger rabbit    like presence    you accept that he s there   but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character    initially   i found jar jar annoying   but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film    on my second viewing of the film   jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn t mind him at all    a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates    despite all the film s struggles between good and evil   and the sober musings about one s destiny and   the force     like all star wars films   the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously    fortunately   lucas hasn t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment   not high art    from the bumbling jar jar   to a one man   two headed announcer team calling the action at the film s thrilling pod race sequence   to a cameo appearance by e   t    in the film   the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun   with lots of half hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed    and finally   the phantom menace works because   as in all his films   there is no shortage of speed and action    from beginning to end   there are light saber battles   hair raising chases   and thrilling duels between good and evil    the pod race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film   and the final showdown between obi wan   qui gon   and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed   most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed    the phantom menace won t win any major oscars    it probably won t beat titanic s box office record    and it s not even the best star wars film   i d put it third   after the original and the empire strikes back      but it s an exciting and entertaining film   far better than your typical summer blockbuster    the film can t live up to it s hype   no film   not even the original star wars   could have done that    but it s still worth seeing        probably more than once

1703	1	seen september 5   1998 at 10 p   m   at the sony nickelodeon theaters   boston   ma     theater  2   with matt perreault for free using my sony loews critic s pass     theater rating       1 2   okay seats   sound   and picture   modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before   from teenage sitcoms to nc 17 rated films about fetishes    the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it       your friends and neighbors   takes a different approach as it s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends    one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer director neil labute s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story    firstly   and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex   detailed story of lust   betrayal   arrogance   hypocrisy   greed   and just plain stupidity between six different characters   three men   three women     without hardly any supporting characters     a few have a line or two     mostly extras    everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full circle back to themselves   whether it be positive or negative    but to just state this is arbitrary   and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult    labute s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat   but what s specifically impressive is the fact the characters  names are never revealed until the end credits roll    for the sake of this review   i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic    another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus    we re always able to tell where the characters are   someone s home   the gym   a restaurant   hotel room   etc       but what the city they live in   what year it is   what the society is like   etc   is relatively unknown    the film is a complete character study with the tight   intense drama of the theater    no one plot dominates the story   which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background    we re simply dropped in on the characters  lives and are expected to figure out the rest    the characters are a group of middle class white people who are all successful at what they do   but they re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives    first there s barry   eckhart   and mary   brenneman     a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don t know what they re problem is    barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife   and the sex they have   but doesn t have a lot of ambition   he just follows everyone else    mary is a writer of some sort   but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character   but ironically   doesn t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something    labute s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals   but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two    obviously   this is the theme   which is enhanced by the actors  good performances   but at the same time seems just a bit hollow    another couple is jerry   stiller   and terri   keener   who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time   yet they constantly argue over anything and everything    their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship    if only one aspect of the film could use improvement   it would be this area    it s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other   but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together    what did they ever see in the other person to begin with    labute never really answers   but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process   it still makes for good drama   tension   and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it s fascinating    two other characters act as catalysts   cary   jason patric   and cheri   natassja kinski      cary is an arrogant   hostile sex maniac who defines the word   bastard      somehow he is able to bend women to his will   either through charm or just attitude   into getting his way    he s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he s secretly perverted   but somehow barry finds comfort in his company   although jerry is always nervous around him    patric gives an outstanding performance   so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is    cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her    she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film   each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different   from becoming involved in a relationship with one   to brushing it off as small talk with another   to being outright appalled by yet another    she s a sweet woman   perhaps the most normal of any of the characters   and although her symbolism is obvious   her role as the outsider is the most relatable    i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others  action   as that s the hook of the film    the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each s scenarios   but it s often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom    the result is sometimes surprising   other times predictable   but the actual course of actions is always fascinating    for a while everyone has their fun   but ultimately each character s guilt   attitude   or ignorance will disserve them    one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be    since the characters only interact with each other there isn t much pop culture references   as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it    are we to assume that these people are   as the title states   our friends and neighbors    i don t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people    often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama   other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie    but what this film does have that the others don t is repercussions in the end    although the film creates its own reality   it goes to show that even the immoral aren t immortal    in what way   your friends and neighbors   is supposed to work is open to interpretation    it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity   but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically    still   it s an accomplishment in film making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective

1805	1	contact   pg   there s a moment late in robert zemeckis s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place    we see a scientist   dressed in a silvery space suit   walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact   spherical space pod   unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops    anticipation   excitement   anxiety   fear  the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character   nervously   breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead    it is this sense of discovery   the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration   that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical   captivating entertainment    jodie foster stars as dr   ellie arroway   a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals    and i mean life  after losing her entire family when she was young   the only thing occupying ellie s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth    after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers   ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega   which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport    from this synopsis   contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact   but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci fi hook    the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe   but perhaps more than anything else   contact is a character study of ellie   whose obsession with empirical   scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power    the irony is that   while admitting to having no religious faith   she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes   in a sense   a religion in its own right    it would be easy for scripters james v   hart and michael goldenberg   in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine   to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones   but they wisely eschew easy answers   giving equal time to both sides   and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane    in the end   there is no right or wrong   nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other   even slightly so  there are just two very viable points of view   each with their own merits   each with their own faults    the complex role of ellie is an actress s dream   and foster   a virtual shoo in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year   more than rises to the challenge    she conveys intelligence   determination   warmth   and   in a gutsy move   always on edge    we root for ellie and feel for her   but we also feel at times that she goes too far    contact is clearly foster s vehicle   but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles    matthew mcconaughey   who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role   holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie   spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss   however   his main storyline   the tentative palmer ellie romance   is the film s weakest subplot      john hurt is effectively creepy as s   r    hadden   the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding    angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine    most memorable of all   though   are tom skerritt and james woods   who play rival scientist dr   david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz   respectively   both   especially skerritt   embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances    zemeckis comes off of his three year break in top shape    always known as a director of effects laden extravaganzas   it comes as no surprise that contact s visual effects are quite stunning    the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001   a space odyssey   but with more advanced technology at his disposal   zemeckis s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick s yet more wondrously pure    and zemeckis doesn t resist the urge to use the always interesting incorporate actors into existing film footage effect   which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump    effects   however   are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama   emotion   and pure wonder   which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump    it says a lot that   in a summer science fiction film such as this   it s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised    the thought provoking   two hour plus contact is a much welcome change of pace from summer no brainers   but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn t entertaining    for all the interesting questions it asks   the film is still what it s being sold as     a journey to the heart of the universe      and what a fascinating   unforgettable journey it is

946	0	   it was not scary      these are the first words that came to mind after it was over    when a movie is called  vampires      not scary   aren t words that should be associated with it    but that wasn t my only gripe    john carpenter is a name associated with cutting edge cinema   as in the intense scares of  halloween     the thing  and  the prince of darkness    or the offbeat action of  they live  and  escape from new york     unfortunately   the only thing that is cutting edge about  vampires  is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach    with an anemic plot and not quite kosher special effects    john carpenter s vampires  has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan    the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers   led by james woods   of all people    like some sort of holy a team   they even have their own souped up van     the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack    their method is amusingly innovative   the blood suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks    to commemorate their victory   the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away    their celebration is short lived   however   as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single handedly destroys most of the team    woods  jack crow and buddy montoya   daniel baldwin   escape with their lives   along with a woman named katrina   sheryl lee      although the woman has been bitten   montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire    the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys  hunt for valek   thomas ian griffith     a freaky marilyn manson type who s on a mission that dates back 600 years    along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau   tim guinee     a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl    upham in  saving private ryan     some stuff happens in the middle of the movie   but i can t remember most of it   because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen     vampires  finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix   as crow   guiteau   and montoya assault an abandoned prison turned vampire nest    only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick    but it s too little too late    we get the inevitable final confrontation   but it seems tacked on and rather anti climactic   come on   we re dealing with  the  master vampire here      interestingly   last summer s vampire actioner  blade  was derived from a comic book   and  vampires  from a novel   yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former   a more deliberate superhero flick    woods  jack crow spouts glib off the cuff one liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh so cool stride    and his motive for killing vampires    take a wild guess       hint   a        killed his       when he was just a            at least  blade  had decent action and slick stylishness     vampires  lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer thin plot    to make up for this   the movie resorts to other   shocks     such as its generally condescending attitude towards women   crow slaps them around for the fun of it   and an overplayed contempt for religion   crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to   getting woodies        it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie    if not scary and gory   i wanted tense   relentless   and exhausting     john carpenter s vampires  is none of these    i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan    for the rest of you looking for a good scare   beware    vampires  is a film with no teeth    
1990	1	i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials   but there isn t    george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant   special effects bound flicks and he has done it again    this is the first star wars film i ve seen on the big screen   so   of course   the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video    what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story   but its amazing visuals    basically   the film s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets    qui gon   liam neeson   and his young apprentice obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   set out with the animated jar jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war    when their ship breaks down and they are stranded   they find a young boy   anakin skywalker   jake lloyd   and his slave mother    qui gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing    anakin participates in a heart pounding podrace   one of the highlights of the film   to get the equipment needed to fix qui gon s ship    however   most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy    meanwhile   queen amadala   natalie portman   is frustrated and at wit s end   being na   ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders    there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film  even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training   the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb    this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made    in all the star wars films   human emotions that we   the audience   can identify with are usually nil   but the films are for pure enjoyment   not for uplifting purposes    despite the fun of watching the movie   the phantom menace is not without flaws    for starters   we have the ill conceived   moronic character jar jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience    what a klutz    george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as   say   yoda   r2 d2   or c3 po   but   alas   his efforts were in vain    secondly   this may be good or bad   depending on your point of view     the movie s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic book feel of the previous three star wars installments    this is due   perhaps   to the utter complexity to this movie s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here    the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions    i can t say much about the acting   though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway    however   there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances  they are straightforward and   at times   stale    natalie portman has a great presence   but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic   unfeeling   enigma    there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance    jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk    despite the inevitable faults   there is so much to enjoy about the movie    the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes   but they are amazing and edge of your seat fun in their own rite    the film is a treasure to look at    the visual effects are astonishing 99   8  of the time  the awe inspiring   mouth opening   eye popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius    not since 1997 s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one    the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element   the previous star wars movies   kubrick s 2001   maybe even of fritz lang s classic silent metropolis    however   all the sets are so original    the original star wars movies can t even match the grandeur of this film s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer  it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode    the costumes are remarkable and have jean paul gaultier written all over them    whether its queen amadala s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold embroidery and feathers   or the jedis  simple brown uniforms   the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness    the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie    as for john williams  score   i don t think he s done one as complex or powerful since   i can t even remember    it is as epic as his schindler s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws    it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films   but williams has added on   made the music much more intense and moving    what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie   one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed    there is very little to hate in the film   it s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick    it is the best   fun   film and the best big budget film out today   most definitely    
337	0	the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes    alas   it refers to our heroes    as it turns out   the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth   via the mir space station   thinks of the human race as a virus    perhaps even a cancer    that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further    after all   we have taken up this entire planet   and if they let us live for another billion years or so   we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one    but the human race doesn t have much to worry about    after all   there s a woman named foster   jamie lee curtis   out there stopping the computer virus    she s the chief navigator on a sea vessel   travelling with her is captain everton   donald sutherland     steve baker   william baldwin     woods   marshall bell     squeaky   julio oscar mechoso     and richie   sherman augustus      they re all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous   abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters    lucky for us   we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board    the evil captain everton thinks he s going to take the ship in and get a reward   he convinces his crew that there s going to be big money   so they try to salvage the ship    soon   however   when it s apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power   they realize that something bad must have happened    finally   they meet nadia   joanna pacula   who explains their situation   a computer virus has taken over the ship    it s creating bio mechanical life forms to eliminate the human race    virus is a truly dumb action thriller   one of negligible intelligence and innovation    when considering the entire film   you will realize that it lacks a single original scene    it s a direct rip off of nearly every james cameron film   aliens   the abyss   and the terminator films are the most plagiarized     more importantly   it s basically the same movie as last year s deep rising    i liked deep rising simply because it s funny    it knows it s silly and derivative    virus takes itself seriously    and   in the most serious manner possible   it steals from every good and bad film of the genre   showing you countless familiar scenes   and sporting a cookie cutter plot that any film of the sci fi horror genre could fit with a little trimming    but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out    okay   let me get this straight    the alien race   which is never really explained   is basically sentient electricity    they need to make themselves physical   so they use a space station to get onto a ship   which is surrounded by water   but who cares about that      on the ship   they make a bunch of clunky   immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people    after that   they start using the dead people to create half human   half machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around    the leader   of course   is a big creature    every film like this has a big creature at the end   but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around    virus is indeed a cliched film   but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn t very threatening    it s established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it   but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there    on one level   virus is almost passable fun    it s really gory   and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal   the director   john bruno   worked on a lot of cameron s films      there s also a nice array of actors   even though none of them do any acting   except for donald sutherland   who does a lot of very bad acting      the bottom line   however   is this   virus is a bad movie    it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing    in that order   i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films   simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes    
1498	1	when quentin tarantino made   pulp fiction     he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s   he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time    but before you send me hate mail for not giving that title to   citizen kane     hear me out    much like   citizen kane       pulp fiction   has changed movie making forever    but i think the latter has had a tad more impact       pulp fiction   has actually ushered in a new era of film making    it has altered the way films will be viewed       fiction   has spawned so many imitations   i ve lost count    sure   some have been excellent     bound   and   the usual suspects   spring immediately to mind     but any serious movie goer recognizes   pulp fiction   as the original neo noir of the 90s    in this review   i hope to change all the people s minds who have criticized it for it s excessive profanity and violence   which   by the way   isn t really that graphic      the most brilliant aspect of tarantino s masterpiece is the screenplay    it is filled with so much classic dialogue   the   quarter pounder with cheese   speech will go down in history     it should be required reading for any film student   if it isn t already    the story   told in unorthodox non linear format   centers around three main episodes   all of which eventually intertwine    the first   titled   vincent vega and marcellus wallace s wife     deals with a very loaded john travolta   i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot up sequence   taking mia wallace   a star making performance by uma thurman     his bosses wife   out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim s    they talk for a while   with the occasional   uncomfortable silence       mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror    after giving marcellus  new bride a foot massage   he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse   giving him a   speech impediment      they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic   you never can tell      i won t reveal the rest of the story   but i ll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night   despite the cool trophy they win    the second story   the least of the three but still four stars   stars bruce willis   proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the   die hard   flicks   as boxer butch coolidge    previously in the film   like i said   it s told in non linear form     he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match    as it turns out   he not only doesn t take the fall   but he ends up actually killing his opponent    he takes a cab to his half witted girlfriend s apartment   and to make a long story short   ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch   sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash back sequence    on his way home   he bumps into   literally   marcellus    the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers   which results in the infamous   gimp   scene   which is very reminicent of the   squeal like a pig      scene from   deliverance      the last   and best   in my opinion   of the episodes features john travolta   again   and samuel l   jackson   in the best performance of any supporting actor ever   as two slightly off kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car    they seek help with a friend of jackson s   played by the q man himself     desperately in need of a stress ball    they end up calling a   cleaner   of sorts   played by the god among men harvey keitel   to help them out    in the end   the story brilliantly loops around itself   actually ending where it began    if you haven t already seen the film   or even if you have   for that matter     i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition    it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen    earlier today   i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago    what the pan and scan did to this movie is inexcusable    that version cut out   like   half the movie    what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing    for instance   when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end   the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses    this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place    just a theory        one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies   i   e       psycho     kiss me deadly       deliverance     etc        but why shouldn t he    it s not like he out right and blatantly stole    give the guy a break    in case you haven t already noticed   i believe   pulp fiction   is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time   up there with such greats as   casablanca   and   the godfather        trust me   you will not see a better film come out of the 90s    and besides   it s one hell of a ride    note   if anyone knows how i could get a   bad motherfucker   wallet   please e mail me    any help would be greatly appreciated

668	0	when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart   it could mean one of two things   that the recently overworked individual is due for a well deserved rest   or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence    the latter s the case with john mctiernan and   the thirteenth warrior     which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring  98 opening   and fast on the heels of mctiernan s   the thomas crown affair   remake   a flick that got good reviews    you don t have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that   thirteenth   won t be so lucky    reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton   whose   eaters of the dead   novel provides   warrior    s source   and its initial title     this messy melange of culture clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish   sorta like   braveheart   without any of the passion    but the bloodshed certainly remains   there s enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills   though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness    these circa 10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside    the good guys are loud   crude   often unintelligible and   judging from their highly icky hygiene habits    pretty smelly to boot   which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador   antonio banderas   who tags along quite reluctantly    they re also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises    you ll wince   you ll groan   you ll grouse     haven t we seen this guy killed twice before      banderas stands confused amidst the chaos   partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal skin fashion run amok    he s not the hero   his soulful eyes and lean build don t exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions   and   the thirteenth warrior   wisely doesn t pretend he is   allowing his foreign and physically imposing co stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough    let the characters interaction sans swords and shields   however   and there s still a struggle   for the audience to follow or even care about the story    it isn t the end until audiences have witnessed a half baked romance   murky political intrigue   veteran actor omar sharif     funny girl     dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic   indiana jones and the temple of doom    esque chase through the villains  underground lair    all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr     but the collaboration between   die hard    helmer mctiernan and   jurrasic park    creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights   graphic action and unintentionally telling moments    heard during   the thirteenth warrior    s final scene   a dog whimpering    how appropriate    
1861	1	it is with hesitance that i call   apocalypse now   a masterpiece    certainly   it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made   with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease   and some of the finest actors of the 1970 s    the plot   an adaptation of joseph conrad s   heart of darkness     was set in vietnam   and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant   coming on the heels of the end of the war       apocalypse   certainly has its moments   some of which are the finest in film history    the plot is fairly simple    captain willard   sheen     is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty    his mission is simple   take a boat up to cambodian territory   and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz   brando     with extreme prejudice      along the way   willard runs into a series of adventures   including one with lt   col   kilgore   duvall     and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies    willard  s four person crew finally make it to kurtz  compound   where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives    willard s experiences with kurtz take up the last half hour   with a confrontation and eventual ending    the movie is visually breathtaking    the battle scenes are exquisitely done   and the score is brilliant   setting a murky mood of darkness that is first rate    the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening    the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning   and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie    the journey to kurtz  camp is quite a ride   with psychosis setting in on almost every character    the most interesting one is kilgore   the lt   col   who cares more about the surf than about the mission    it is at times revolting   psychotic   and incredible   and it is one hell of a movie    the scenes are bold   inventive   and powerful   and the acting is stunning   especially be sheen   duvall   and fishburne    the narration is exquisite   as is the mystery of kurtz    coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam   kind of like   saving private ryan   on lsd    the film is jarring in its implications   and psychotic in its execution    the problems come when the film slows down    one of the major scenes in the film   where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz   is a colossal mess    the dialogue is confusing   the lighting is atrocious   and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film    the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound    the film slows down to a drag    sheen seems forever captured by a madman   played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received    brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes   but is bathed in shadows the entire time   making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic    the scenes are poorly done   the dialogue is muffled   and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief    sheen seems to adore this man   but why the viewers are never told    the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god like kurtz   but the scenes fall way short of expectations    granted   it has its moments   which are brutally horrific   but the general feeling is one of confusion    brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir   and my feeling was that this could never be a great man   this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him   so why do they do it    there are moments of brilliance   but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene    there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending    the finest scene at the end is sheen s escape   and his entrace into the temple    his rise out of the water   with the smoke coming off of his slicked head   is a brilliant 30 seconds of film    yet   you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done    the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times   and indeed the film on the whole is very good    it is a stunningly flawed expression of film   for it addresses major issues   such as man s mental stamina during bouts of war    but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful   had the character of kurtz been more explored   and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for    there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece   but it could have been so much more rewarding    
329	0	 the bachelor  is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see    wading through this gooey   detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic    those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere    the bachelor  is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy    awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money    although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty boy cocoon   chris o donnell has an effortless charm as an actor    most will recognize him as the high flying robin from the two latest  batman  films   but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile    can o donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders    perhaps   if he found the proper vehicle        but  the bachelor  falls far short of the requirements    the actor just can t register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success    a few instances of adorable humor aside   it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is  the bachelor     o donnell plays jimmie   a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who s progressing in a serious relationship with anne   renee zellweger      jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals   and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage    the problem is that his proposal sucks    big time    you can tell things aren t going pleasantly   because jimmie gets the infamous   deer in the headlights  look when anne questions his approach    and then   the plot   along with the stupidity of the movie   thickens    jimmie s grandfather   peter ustinov   dies suddenly   leaving a video will behind for his grandson   who also happens to be his only living relative      everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie    of course   there s a catch   he must get married before his 30th birthday   stay joined with his bride for an entire decade   and produce healthy children within the first five years    the bad news is that jimmie s birthday is the following day    with anne out of town   he must find a willing bride to share his riches with        and within a very limited time frame    there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of  the bachelor     for one   the movie s approach is interesting and not dripping with clich      another is the colorful cast    o donnell and zellweger are cute together   and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it s own mediocrity    ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure   and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie s marital adventures    and now the cons   the approach may be interesting   but in trying an old fashioned method   director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel    the characters are drawn with obvious   broad strokes   and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable    yes    the bachelor  is far more frustrating than cute    the screenplay is lamely written   and the subject matter poorly conceived    the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted   along with whatever promise the film initially contained    potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor s  colorful  approach   but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director s wishes     the bachelor  becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it    you ve seen the tv spots   haven t you    o donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads  what is this man running from      in actuality   he s fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune   it s one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film      after seeing the movie   i believe that the approaching horde could be something else    o donnell could be running from his angry fans   who have just endured  the bachelor    and are hunting him down for revenge    
1934	1	armageddon   in itself   symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking    stories have been replaced with special effects   character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue   plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up    armageddon is as stupid   as loud and as shallow as any movie you ll see come out this summer   or maybe even any other summer    but i loved every freaking minute of it    believe me   i m just as shocked as you are    hell   i don t even know why i went to see it in the first place    the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year   or at least in the running    i m sorry   but   somebody dial 911          isn t quite the tagging that s going to sell a movie    it isn t too wise either to market the film using the movie s stupidest lines     beam me up scotty     yeah   that sure is great writing            i mean   let s face it   armageddon s previews rival the truman show s as being some of the worst of the year    neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice    of course   you all know the story    when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas   nasa calls in the us s top oil drillers       to go into space       and implant a nuclear device eight hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid          in the coarse of all this mayhem   we are introduced to some interesting   and not so interesting   characters    belonging to the former group is rockhound   steve buscemi     a horny little womanizing genius who s always full of wisecracks   even when flying into space at a huge amount of g s    also   there s the always cool as hell billy bob thornton as dan truman   the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers    he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13   only without the intensity and great lines to deliver    then on the flip side of the coin is the tired   contrived character of harry stamper   bruce willis   who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can t quite place     the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie    basically   that s about it    as i said   this is hardly a film about plot    it s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden    case in point   nasa doesn t know that there is even an asteroid on it s way until eighteen days before impact   huh    another example   at one point in the movie   two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy    how pretentious is that              want another one    okay   before the oil drillers blast off into space   one of them starts singing   leaving on a jet plane     and soon   all the rest join in    did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture    but naturally   all this sappiness   melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin  time at the movies    and don t get me wrong   despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon   i still very much enjoyed it    so even if you don t win one of mcdonald s free tickets   it s still definitely worth checking out    
444	0	the original  babe  was my favorite movie of 1995   a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience    being a surprise commercial and critical success   it had no marketing tie ins   which limited its final take    thus   babe 2 arrives   with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1    plush dolls   vending machines hawking t shirts   and macy s thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money grubbing    too late    this is a sad review to write   because babe 2 not only does  not  live up to the original   but it doesn t even come to a fraction of it    i shouldn t expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors  magic   but this film tries too hard   and loses its charm    consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity   unaware that his car is in neutral    imagine with me   if you will    scream  s jamie kennedy   explaining the   rules   for sequels like babe 2       1   there must be  more  talking animals       2   there must be  more  slapstick comedy       3   there must be  more  songs for those mice to sing   that s cute       4   keep the story cards to break up the action   that s cute too   even though   the pig gets wise   made no sense   given the context of that story partition       5   there must be action   however illogical   that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original   the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to   the baa ram ewe secret code   the   that ll do   pig    that ll do      now throw in the limitations     a   james cromwell   now a hot commodity   has limited time on the set   or maybe he didn t approve of the script         b   christine cavanaugh   the voice of the original babe   demands more money    200   000  paltry considering the  80 million budget      out    e   g    daily comes in with noticable results       c   george miller   the director   is more well known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment   not for kiddie fare   and no   he didn t direct that  andre  film in  94         d   the special effects are impressive    but limited     babe talks   but most of the time from a single shot   repeated over and over again       babe is center screen   looking straight into the camera   with a happy smirk  regardless of whether he s happy   or scared   or tired      season now with the   original   elements   which   as we will find out   are straight from the screenwriting is hell bin       i   change the venue into   the big city      this has been praised as wildly original    excuse me   didn t  home alone  do this several years ago    how about the muppets    even  the bad news bears  travelled to tokyo    sorry    no dice    side note   to give the city a fairy tale look   george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world s great cities   and yes   it  is  impressive    but this too is over used   repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions    and   for the most part   babe  remains in the hotel        ii   given the limitations of cromwell   the human element is taken over by   the boss  wife   played by magda szubanski    s t r e t c h    she s not a lead actress type   she s not funny enough in her physical comedy   and she s simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls       have her arrested falsely on drug charges    have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes    have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner      i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes   but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in    i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film   the violence   the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge   head submerged underwater    even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it   as the brothers grimm have demonstrated    no       my problem is with the story   or lack thereof     babe  is sent out to save the hoggett farm   but once in the city   that story is forgotten    being a good natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice   but   other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull   what did babe actually  do     without giving the ending away   the farm is saved from a left field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig    speaking of   pig     or     pig pig pig pig pig        the word   pig   is so overused   had they changed it to an expletive   and had the pig be al pacino   i could have been watching  scarface     this is screenwriting    further   i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups    had it been a cartoon   and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd   maybe my reaction would have been softened    but to farmer hoggett    his wife    an elderly mickey rooney    much too irreverent         quick    splice those singing mice into those scenes          the film isn t a colossal failure    i did like glenne headley s schmoozy chimpanzee    i liked the pink poodle    the dog on the cart   who momentarily thinks he s in dog heaven    and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly cast as an airport employee and a judge    but most of the time   i was looking down   in boredom   or in embarrassment over the hacked up script    them singing mice   those chapter partitions   the proficient acting of the animals   none of these can compensate for a story    let me spoil the final scene   farmer hoggett looks at pig   proud   says   that ll do   pig    that ll do      that s it    hope i didn t ruin it for you    but tell me this   what the heck did that pig  do

1603	1	i rented   brokedown palace   last night blind   having heard nothing about it beforehand   and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws    for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety    that is no easy task    superficially   it bears an unfortunate   and not necessarily unintended   resemblance to several other movies   notably   return to paradise   and   midnight express      as a result nearly every review of   brokedown palace   i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons    the consequence was nearly universal condemnation   which is a shame as this is a fine film    for those who have yet to view the movie   let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system   as was   midnight express     nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of   return to paradise      in my view   if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad s acclaimed novel     lord jim      problematically   the basic storyline seems more than familiar   two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set up involving a suave con man   a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world   justice   system    the girls are alice   claire danes   and darlene   kate beckinsale      they re life long buddies who planned a high school graduation trip to hawaii   and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents    once there   they find a  6 hotel and go sight seeing   which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside    they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room   a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them   but they are saved from hotel security by a charming   friendly australian   nick   daniel lapaine     who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl s scam    he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves   first toward alice   then toward darlene    by now alarm bells are going off among viewers    the ever present nick is too slick and his stories don t add up   to us     the girls   of course   are too naive to notice    long before it happens   we re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag   literally   containing heroin    just as predictably   the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison bound for a long stretch    left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice    for those in need of a ready answer   might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl s fleabag hotel    as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed   the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer fixer   yankee hank     bill pullam   and his thai born partner wife    a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film s tag lines     who do you trust       and hank is no exception although seasoned movie  goers and those familiar with pullman s oeuvre will find few surprises    much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short hand fashion    lou diamond phillips   for instance   plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who   while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank   withholds vital information at crucial moments    is he part of a wider conspiracy    with an inherently powerful   if somewhat tired premise   the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama   a prison story   and a potential character study of american teens   their relationship   and what constitutes friendship between them    the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful   with the girls  interaction   hank s investigation   and the various trials and hearings   offering hope for their release   delivering tension  as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape    if   brokedown palace   has a major flaw   it is its creators  tendency   like time constrained tourists   to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half way down and return to the story s main avenue    and   if that were all there was to   brokedown palace     it wouldn t be a very good movie    but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and   in this   they succeeded    for the main theme of the movie   like the proffered name of its location   is freedom  in all its permutations    ultimately   the other sub themes may be considered window dressing    young and pretty   alice   danes   is an old soul   a wild   streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure    presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang   dark and light   is her cautious best friend   darlene   beckinsale      clear eyed and straightforward   alice is more complex than her friend    she comes from a poorer background   has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone   including her own father      whereas darlene s life is   on track     aimed at college   marriage   kids   a career   a suburban home   middle age and   fulfillment     alice s is uncertain   unfocused   and yearning    one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors  friends and relatives from home   whose lives continue while hers is in limbo    tellingly   alice is present but not included    just as revealing of their different personalities   when alice and dar first come to thailand   the openness and delight on alice s face doesn t read as simple naivet     the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat   reaching toward the sun   she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom   while   dar   remains seated in the shade       brokedown palace   begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank    however unintentional   it s all alice s fault    she s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents   to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand   to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick       in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film s beginning   darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison      dar   of course   is the willing dupe which   in her view   confers innocence    never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate    dar is innocent    it doesn t matter    alice is the subject of this movie    she and her journey toward personal freedom    along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half baked sensibilities and materialistic goals    in the end   that culture   like its representatives     yankee   hank and dar s father   a   man who knows how to grease the wheels       proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl s tragedy    thailand s culture   contrary to most opinion   comes off much better by comparison    it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes    i believe the filmmaker s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior    the thai   with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy   were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles    the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native born    their prison   in stark contrast to the probable reality   was no hellhole   being relatively clean and sunlit    the prison authorities demanded good hygiene   provided medical care when needed   and   hard manual labor   consisted of picking grass    the thai guards were authoritarian   what else     but certainly not routinely sadistic    as for the thai justice system   the reasoning of the thai judges   during both an appeal hearing and in the film s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality     freedom  has many faces and   brokedown palace   explores many of them    in the extreme   we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit    some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter    but freedom seldom comes without a price    which is why the movie s other tag lines are     what is your dream      and   how far would you go      i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom   incarcerated or not   by film s end is alice    she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility    i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact    kate beckinsale s character might more properly be likened to the   released   temple bird referred to twice during the film     trained to fly back to its cage      as the thai magistrate observed in the film s climactic scene   the issue was always one of   character     and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that   freedom   is achieved within oneself    if one thinks back over the movie   which character was transformed by their experiences    increasingly   the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of  kung fu woman   female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures    here   at last   is the story of a modern heroine    in reading the many user s comments   i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon   whether or not a person liked the movie   almost everyone praised the actors    think about that    when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it   but raving about all the performances in it    do yourself a favor   rent   brokedown palace   and watch it with a open mind    there s more there than meets the eye

1872	1	originally entitled dancing about architecture   i   e       talking about love is like dancing about architecture       but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box office dud dancing at lughnasa   this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names   playing interesting and well written characters   within a vignettes styled plot arrangement a la robert altman    plot   follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love   finding themselves   regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are   and who they want   and appreciating the fine emotional art of love    critique   charmingly effective romantic drama   this film offers insight into various types of relationships   presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast   and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties    how do people fall in love    why do people fall out of love    how do people fall back into love   once they ve been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club    all of these questions and more   are touched upon in this film   within several types of variant relationships    meet a hip   young couple going through their first date    a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships    a married woman   finding herself   while cheating on her husband    a husband letting go of his inhibitions    an older couple dealing with a past   love   of the man   a secret recently uncovered    a son dying from aids   joined by his mother at the hospital    there are many nuances to this picture   and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate   but more importantly   there is diversity    diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels    some related to the younger couples  issues    others with the married    there s a little bit of everything for everyone in here    and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year   i would relate myself to yet another predicament    just like love itself   this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels    the actors in this film are all also very   very good    sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve   as is gena rowlands   as the aging wife with trepidations    jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance   while philippe is as pretty boy as ever    anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re ignite her love life   opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk show host   jon stewart    even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film   and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination    the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached   was the part surrounding jay mohr   the man dying from aids   and his mother   ellen burstyn    the actors were fine   but somehow   the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else    the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me   but i guess that s just hollywood    this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors   5   5 10   and happiness   4   5 10   in concept and style   but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness    the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care   as opposed to this film   which offers rich and believable characters   living real lives and talking about real issues in today s relationships    all in all   this movie offers many interesting characters   talking and living genuine and engaging love lives   wonderful performances by its solid cast   too sweet of an ending   but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless    little known facts about this film and its stars   according to a story in the london sunday mirror

571	0	as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment   hollywood doesn t loose the oppertunity to get involved   by telling stories and expressing opinions    this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels   hays hodges   tommy lee jones   and terry childers   samuel l   jackson      they fought side by side in vietnam   where childers saved hodges  life by shooting an unarmed pow    that s against the rules of war but understandable   in this story anyway   under the specific circumstances    certainly hodges is not complaining    years pass    hodges   whose wounds make him unfit for action   gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer    childers   is now a respected and much decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould    because of his excellent record   childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador   ben kingsley     cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops    childers does what he has to do   evacuate the family and protect the men under his command    after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire   he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd    more than 80 yemeni men   women   and children are mowed down    childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians    he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film    did childers violate authorized u   s   military rules of engagement    or are there simply no rules in war    the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious   but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions    the murder of 83   innocent civilians   has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u   s   where is the accusations from the arab leaders    where is the u   n      the film ends without even telling the most interesting story   what happens on the international arena    this film   in a way akin to films such as   a few good men     has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism    these accusations are pretty heavy   but also unfair    what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking    one of the earliest apparent problems with  rules of engagement  is its lack of credibility    the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now   but is overdone   contrived and unrealistic   as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed    a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality    that is precisely why it s not offensive    it is completely unobjective    many stories are started and never finished    many questions are asked   but never answered    a lot of parallels are referring to nothing    it seems that neither the director   producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film    is it about arab mentality    america s foreign policies    america s role in the world    corruption in the higher circles    it goes on and on    it consists of countless stories   but not a definable plot    it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one    i think that it is ironic   because director william friedkin s probably most acclaimed film was   the exorcist   which had a silly story   but became a rather effective film    in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film    though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism   such as the impressive battle scenes     his latest film does simply not engage    i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed    it s obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe    the characters feel designed   unreal   merely shadows   with no life outside the conflict    even the actors can not save this film from going under    though both jackson and jones act admirably   with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this   it is not something that these great actors can boast of    they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back    jackson is gray and jones uninteresting    the rest of the cast   including ben kingsly   blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks    the time has come for the verdict    on the charges of complete lack of objectivity   i find this film guilty    on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking   i find it guilty    but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty   because of it s inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere   not only when concerning the arab population    i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far   portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad guys    this is very sad   since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth    however   it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states    and that it s not a coincidence that u   s   residents in the middle east   including yemen are on constant maximum alert

1067	1	what a great film    what a stunning   touching   heart wrenching   heart warming   life affirming   miraculous film     from its opening moments    life is beautiful  walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy    a car with no brakes speeds through the town   and guido   roberto benigni   motions people to move out of the way    they mistake him to be the fascist president   traveling to their town that day    heil    heil    huh    shortly thereafter   the president drives through   and people stare   with blank faces    this is standard   but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff   the clown who is also a jew   triumphs over the anti semitic society in which he   lives    granted    the great dictator  comes to mind  charlie chaplin s almost masterpiece    i think lib   which benigni wrote and directed   trumps gd in one essential point   chaplin s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax   but to do so   he had to break completely from character    benigni is given a similar situation   he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary   and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren   on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race    benigni s guido stays in character   and delivers the speech   keeping   the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept    it   is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema    there are many other scenes   especially in the first half   which are bright and loopy and funny and silly    slapstick reigns   and although the film is subtitled   there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed    and although it s focus is on the courtship of guido   to dora   played by nicoletta braschi   benigni s real life wife     a silent undercurrent creeps in    this is clearly a racist society   evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others   and it will soon affect him and   his family    the second half of the film takes place five years later   in an unnamed concentration camp   where guido   dora   by her insistence     and their five year old son   giosu e9   giorgio cantarini     are deported    guido   seeing the horrors   is desperate to protect his wife and child    for   his wife   who is separated from him   he must find ways to communicate to   her that he is all right    for his son     and this is the most controversial part of the film   he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game   it s rules include hiding   being very quiet   and learning to not ask for seconds    which raises the big questions   how do we deal with pain    with persecution    with injustice on the worst level    it s said that tragedies bring out the best in people   finding strengths they did not realize they had    other times they deteriorate   become overwhelmed   with little strength or incentive to swim    sometimes even   people giggle in these moments   as if there were a vacant emotion behind them   yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds    benigni s guido realizes this    he is the clown   but he is not a fool    he sees the slurs and the vandalism   and while feeling the weight of   the verbal attacks   he still has the audacity to see if everyone around   him   perhaps even the antagonists   laugh    his liberty is stripped   but not his dignity   and certainly not the dignities of those around him    it s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation   but does so with a grinning   joyful demeanor    perhaps that is a form of denial    perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster   not unlike the very different  brazil       or        perhaps this is an example of great fortitude   with no weapons but   wit    whatever his purposes is subject to debate   but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three dimensional characters   stranded amidst   a terrifyingly risky concept    surprisingly   it works    it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust    it s not that the atrocities are trivialized   far from it    they don t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror  less is more    i believe   that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone   and i like the theory that   it is guido s alternate reality that we re seeing    however   any criticism that this is rewriting history   that the holocaust wasn t as bad as it seems   is simply off target    benigni s film has won audience awards at cannes   at toronto   and is a definite shoo in for best foreign language film   hopefully for best picture as well      he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society    it swept the italian academy awards    controversy notwithstanding   it is one of the great films this year   and as of this writing   the one to beat for best film    masterful    miraculous    a must see

1106	1	based on the boris karloff s classic by the same name   the mummy starts off with the high priest of osiris   imhotep   who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible    bandaged up   having his tongue removed   and being covered in flesh eating scarab beetles   then entombed       all while still alive    recap a few thousand years later   where a soldier named rick   played by brandan fraser   aids a young historian named evelyn   played by rachel wiesz   and her brother   jonathan   played by john hannah   in finding the book of amon ra   in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy    problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress   using evelyn as a sacrifice        walking in with relatively low expectations   i thought this movie was actually pretty good    the visuals and cgi are astounding   and obviously not cheaply done at all    they pack a ton of detail into the images   especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi    the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes   such as unnerving moments involving flesh eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him   after all   those who took his artifacts are cursed      unfortunately   the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time   becoming a tug of war for control between genres    on one hand   it is a fast paced action film    on the other   it s a frightening horror film    and on the side   it s a hilarious comedy    ideally   for it to be successful   the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect   with one character serving as the comic relief   that would be johnson      the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief   with rick occasionally delivering his witty one liner    if they were trying to make a horror action comedy   it would have helped if it were established early on in the film   but unfortunately   with the backstory of imhotep s entombment   that would be impossible    and then there s the slapstick fight scene between a sword wielding rick and an army of mummies    while really well done   it had the feel of slapstick comedy    replace the sword with a chainsaw and you d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness    while entertaining and funny   it feels really out of place    but at least it s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of    on the whole   the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end   entertaining the audience    but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners       turn  the sound down    while a lot of theatres have good sound systems   my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre   the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you re not careful      when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film     end of days     it was so loud i couldn t make anything out    
1193	1	i must admit i m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity   because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend    the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity    i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre   but something drew me to this film    maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role   and the hilarious eugene levy    maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity   con air   and pushing tin    but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life    the story of serendipity is simple    two people   john trager   john cusack   and sara thomas   kate beckinsale   looking ever so hot     have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves    with buck henry smack dab in the middle    charmed beyond repair   these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf   called serendipity   talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down   and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink    but with each of them already involved with other parties   sara has john write his name and number on a  5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera    sara declares that if this   thing      let s just call it love    is destined to happen   fate will bring them together in the future    years later and on opposite coasts of america   john and sara    both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates    decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts    what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat and mouse game with the fates   involving such items as mistaken identity   a graduate homage   john corbett as a freaky new age musician   and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman    to find out if that   thing   was right after all    fortunately   first time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong   well rounded   characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative    coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom   director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones   and the use of time lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years    the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity    both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters  on the flipside   films such as you ve got mail   made in heaven   and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film s main journey at hand    but it s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture

1261	1	richard linklater s   slacker     made in 1991 for a budget of only  23   000   immerses itself in the twentysomething   college town culture of austin   texas    most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning    their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation   they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy   the pervasiveness of slave morality   the subtle messages in pop culture   and such    ask them what they ve been doing lately   and they ll more likely than not reply     oh   you know   just hanging out      linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters   the camera follows one person for a few minutes   then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person   who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door                it s certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk   some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas   some of them are just plain weird   and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are    the opening monologue   delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver   tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film    other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy   while groups of pseudo intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery based morality in   scooby doo      for the most part   however   the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types    near the beginning   a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks   warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars    another man seems to be collecting televisions   keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera    and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film   a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below    the only problem with   slacker   is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end    since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character   the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while    there are only so many times you can hear     hey   what s going on         not much   what are you up to         nothing really   just hanging around     before it gets on your nerves   the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization    and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half   a jfk buff   for example   seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist   and many of the characters just generally aren t as weird or unique    instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first   linklater shows us the oddballs first   then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too       slacker   is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy   whatever its flaws   and its status as a cult classic is well deserved    i just can t help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order    
519	0	you don t look at a ren   magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning    you likewise don t look at one for 88 minutes straight    surrealist works are notable for their quirks   and they are fun   but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting    that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died   a surrealistic   hyperactive comedy with no dialogue    it s not a silent movie   there is lots of atmospheric music   occasional screams and weird sound effects   but nobody ever utters an audible word    though the film is distinctive   its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes   and as it progressed   watching became a chore    the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo legendary ed wood   the man behind such   classics   as plan 9  from outer space and night of the ghouls    the joke   of course   is that his films are so bad   they re good   so humorous in their inanity that they become hits    i woke up early the day i died   unfortunatly   is so bad that it s really bad    it stars billy zane   titanic   as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse   escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around   stealing a car   clothes   and a load of money    our thief reaches a cemetery   where he witnesses a bizarre ritual    he falls asleep and finds himself   literally   in a hole   with his money gone    for whatever reason   he is bent on getting his hard unearned cash back   considering how easily he stole it the first time   why didn t he just go steal some more        he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don t have what he is looking for    i don t think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short    the subject and the style seem to have been made for it    unfortunately   twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length   and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome    it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on   up to the point where halfway through i was already weary    it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious   but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is    i woke up early the day i died is a comedy   i guess   though it could have fooled me    unlike most ed wood films   this one tries to be funny and fails   instead of the other way around    there s nothing inherently wrong with that   in fact   i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so   good   at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one    whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we ll never know   but in either case   this is a failure    jonathan taylor thomas   christina ricci   summer phoenix   john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos    ricci   for example   plays a prostitute    her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out    thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff    was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work    zane   meanwhile   occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up    lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature    the carnival side show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no budget production    it s desperately unfunny   but thinks it s the funniest thing since plan 9     it s so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction    i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send off       1999 eugene novikov   137

5 years later reborn as spawn   a general in hell s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives   chains   and a morphing cape    sullen   wise cogliostro and flatulating   wisecracking violator vy for spawn s attention    comments   when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics   where he had made a name for himself as a first rate comic book penciller on the   spider man   titles   to join the newly formed   creator owned image comics   a new comic book legend was born   spawn    mcfarlane s   spawn   immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s    mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate   allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max    the early   spawn   issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing    with the popularity of   spawn   and the success of the current warner bros    s batman film franchise   a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn    in the summer of 1997   hence   new line cinema released spawn   a live action film based on the groundbreaking series    this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book   like me   numbed by how much spawn misses the mark    what happened    why is spawn so bad    todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo    i don t think   however   that his presence necessarily hurt   or helped   the film    i place the blame   in part   on the recent hollywood trend   fueled by public demand apparently   for special effects blow out movies utilizing the latest computer technology    these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else   character   plot   dialogue   etc   spawn   reflecting this trend   shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics    hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires   explosions   knives and chains appearing out of nowhere   glowing eyes   or constantly transforming demons    a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid   don t get me wrong   but   because the script and cast aren t engaging   spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper   the surface may capture the eye   but nothing exists underneath      spawn s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level    mcfarlane s spawn was a tortured hero    a mercenary by trade   al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda    having died and journeyed to hell   he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda    simmons   however   discovers that his memories are fragmented   his body a creepy mess   and his wife married    despite his sometimes violent nature   readers couldn t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld    spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so    when the characters are developed   they seem absurd rather than touching    the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot   a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat 16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world   do not help matters    spawn   in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman   also unwisely spends too much time on a villain   the violator   batman favored the joker over batman      john leguizamo   like jack nicholson in batman   receives top billing in the cast as the violator   michael jai white   al simmons   spawn   is second    i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator    the film   however   spends so much time on the violator s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves    apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film   as nicholson was in batman     especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn   the violator s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny   leaving the audience wishing he would leave    leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role   but he is seen far too often in the film    michael jai white   a relative newcomer to theatrical releases   seems to be an appealing actor   and he handles his role adequately   but we see little of him without various masks on    more time needed to be spent on white s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings    a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over the top   obnoxious   evil general wynn    easily the hammiest performance in the movie   it s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much   after all   he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now    sheen s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain

1584	1	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    milos forman s first film since the ill fated valmont   columbia s the people vs    larry flynt   is a vastly entertaining   if not particularly enlightening   biopic of hustler publisher and self made millionaire larry flynt   who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s    the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order   we open with young and dirt poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy   peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky    cut to forward in time   where the two flynt brothers   now young men   are running the struggling hustler go go clubs in cincinnati    the strip clubs are in a dire financial state   and in a last ditch effort to salvage the operations   flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter    this evolved into the adult periodical  hustler  magazine   creating larry flynt a vast financial empire   and the rest is history    what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material   and who railed and preached against him   flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt   and his driven   single minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression   regardless of personal cost    the people vs    larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt s true love   althea leasure   whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries   and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations    considering the serious nature of the film s theme   the importance of the united states  first amendment   the people vs    larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light hearted and humourous    much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt s outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances   some of his chosen apparel is hilarious   and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points   such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity    the film s focus is on the flynt s many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech   but the heart of the people vs    larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea    larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff   harsh   and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues   but with althea   we see his loving   affectionate side    there s a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking    ultimately   the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors   but from the strength of flynt and althea s love for each other    woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt    harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience   and a very compelling protagonist for the film    courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn   completely raw and impulsive    it s a very solid performance   brash and naturalistic   and love is extremely compelling   it s difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen   and her chemistry with harrelson is dead on    edward norton   as flynt s straight   level headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co stars in the people vs    larry flynt   much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes   but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film    one can sense the frustration that norton s character feels when harrelson s free talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind   and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton s isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges    milos forman keeps the film moving   although it runs over two hours   it never drags   and his direction of the film is very effective   eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic    there s also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot   which is both clever and extremely entertaining    two minor quibbles with the film   it certainly seems like the people vs    larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme   with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech    consequently   the first thirty minutes of the film   introducing and setting up the characters   seem unduly rushed   perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting   but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion    it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters   the film clearly shows what flynt   althea   isaacman   and rev   jerry faldwell did   and on a superficial level some of their motivations   but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level    for example   why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton   president carter s sister   to be born again is a mystery to me    then again   perhaps it was to him as well    these two points don t detract greatly from the film    the people vs    larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio released films of 1996   and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression   and as a touching love story

936	0	ex universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer model engineered fighters gone bad    the review  jean claude van damme has a one liner early on in universal soldier   the return   his latest attempt to remain relevant   that sums up this entire movie   he says   been there   done that      no film critic could possibly sum up van damme s recent film choices any better    while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres   schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films     van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him   martial arts and guns    this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world   with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex    he joins fellow martial artist action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away    universal soldier   the return is truly poor    the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade   specifically terminator 2   judgement day and the similarly named soldier    soldier s kurt russell was an older model super soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors   for the good of a planet   schwarzenegger s terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine   the t 1000   and jean claude   a former universal soldier   has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of   you guessed it   newer model soldiers    considering the poor box office performance of soldier   it s amazing that this project was ever given the go ahead    luc devereaux   van damme   was the sole remaining universal soldier   or unisol for short     until he was returned to a normal   if muscular   human form    in this sequel   technically the fourth film in the series   following two straight to video duds that were ignored here plot wise     luc is now a human trainer consultant of sorts for the unisol program    working with dylan cotner   xander berkeley   who interestingly also appeared in t2     the unisol program has engineered a tougher   fiercer fighting force with the help of super computer seth    unfortunately   upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government   seth takes control of his soldiers   killing everyone in the building except for luc   his partner maggie   his daughter hillary and erin   a reporter trapped inside    the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive   while beating up a group of near indestructible soldiers   most notably romeo   popular wrestler goldberg      there are lots of fights   gun battles   lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility    there are so many clich   s in this film that it is almost painful to watch    luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on   and in the course of a single night   they go from bickering to falling for each other   to kissing    erin is a pathetically written character   people are getting brutally gunned down all around her   and yet   not only does this not seem to frighten her   but she finds time to remind luc that she   isn t leaving without her story      whatever    other laughable moments include a   luc going to a strip club to get internet access   what     and b   a group of rangers   who after having been given good advice   luc tells them that their weapons are useless   and shows them a specific gun which should work better     choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway   guess who wins the battle        not one single scene in universal soldier   the return has any originality to it    when fuelled by don davis  loud   driving music score   the film s many fights become almost passable   but mostly are full of the same ol  jean claude moves    director mic rodgers   a former stunt co ordinator   keeps the action coming at a rapid pace   with only a few token serious moments to be found    his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows   tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion    if only jean claude weren t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li   rodgers could probably have made a decent action film    to place the blame squarely at van damme s feet   however   is an injustice    i m not sure that anyone   not even robert deniro or edward norton   could make writers william malone and john fasano s script sound good    one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access    he cringes   looks down and mutters   uh       uhm        they all do   i saw it on 60 minutes    eh he he he   the script s and indeed the entire film s only saving grace is goldberg    he chews up every scene he is in   obviously enjoying his role immensely    he even gives the film a few laughs   as he mutters things like   i really don t like that guy   every time he fails to kill luc    sadly   his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier   the return into anything better than a below average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight to video    
271	0	if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films   i might say that i review movies that don t look particularly good because i m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it    if that were true   i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads     shay casey   seeing bad movies so you don t have to      but i know that s bunk you re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say    so i have to tell the truth   every once in a while i get a nasty   masochistic urge to see a bad movie    you know the feeling   when you re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly    sometimes i think that s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies   ever    admit it   sometimes you like seeing bad movies    so do i    so i saw   supernova      truth be told     supernova   wasn t quite as bad as i thought it might be    maybe i just felt sorry for the actors   or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn t started tinkering with the director s   walter hill   final cut   causing him to want his name removed    maybe i m becoming a softy    in any case   i didn t find   supernova   as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe    but it s still bad    the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel   nightingale      the crew includes captain a   j    marley   robert forster     his new second officer nick vanzant   james spader     head medical officer kaela evers   angela bassett     medical technicians yerzy penalosa   lou diamond phillips   and danika lund   robin tunney     and computer technician benj sotomejor   wilson cruz      there are some attempts at   characterization     but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction   which puts kaela on edge   yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy faces at each other every five minutes   and benj   apparently gay   is in love with the computer   apparently female      don t expect any more explanation   because you won t get it    anyway   the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent    during the dimension jump   i think that s what it s called   but don t hold me to it     the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal   peter facinelli   is brought on board    he calls himself troy larson   making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with    then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening    have you seen   alien      have you seen   event horizon     a lame movie in its own right      good    then you ve seen   supernova      post production cuts or not   there is nothing original about this screenplay   and nothing unpredictable either    after all   no one s going to think for a second that troy won t turn out to be a villain    but the bigger problem with   supernova   is that it can  t just stick to the simple plot it s afforded    numerous re writes   the script may be credited to three people   but it s a gross underestimate   have crammed this lean 90 minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped    was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot    did the ship s computer learn something about humanity    what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him    and just what does the film s title signify   if anything    as far as i can tell   it refers to a very small plot detail that isn t developed   just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements    character relationships in this film also make very little sense    for some reason   every person in this film keeps having sex    we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes    bassett and spader s characters start off hating each other    fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later   they re engaging in some hanky panky    when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship   of course both female crew members will fall in love with him    every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly   which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut    the most prominent example   however   may be the fact that when the film starts   there are no opening credits    furthermore   the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits    maybe that s why the film s title is mentioned twice during the end credits   right between james spader and robert forster    right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you re seeing   lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery     you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene   with little to no introduction to any of the characters or situations    the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes   you know   where they explain things   and just went from point a to point b   point a   danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby    point b   tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing    doesn t make sense    since i didn t understand anything about these characters  motivations   did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one by one   and he does   knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes      not a whit    it s a shame   because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do    they don t find it    bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces    sexual tension    more like constipation    maybe they re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as   this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice      not that we ever find out who that is   mind you    the climax of their relationship   taking place in a transport pod   is probably the film s biggest forehead slapper    as troy   peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected    he  s awfully one note   but it s not as if he s given any more notes to work with    the rest of the cast does even less    tunney stands around looking cute   then scared    phillips broods    cruz flirts with the computer    then they all die and a star blows up or something   but i really wasn t paying much attention by then       supernova   is pretty awful   but i m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got    that s it    if you expect it to be good   for whatever reasons you may have     you ll probably hate it more than i will    even the special effects are fairly unimpressive   nothing you haven  t seen before   and suffice to say the script isn t going to save the film    honestly   though   what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym    it usually results in a bad movie   and that s what   supernova   is    
1930	1	i swear i have seen the edge before    in fact   it reminded me of the bear   the river wild   and other various films mixed into an entirely different film    however   the edge has done something that most action films should do   and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot    in doing so   the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than   say   the peacemaker    unfortunately   because of those overused moments   we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film    but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head    one surprise   in particular   left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script    action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood   and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us   they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre   intelligence    even horror films have learned this   a genre which is probably the least respected of them all    the river wild was one of the best action suspense films i have seen from the 90s    the intelligence of the screenplay   and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day    the edge has the intelligence and smart characters   but this time the lack of originality is the downfall    i must admit that it was very suspenseful   and had an original third half   but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes    this is an example of the final act saving the film   instead of the other way around   as in the lost world      if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes  intensity   it could have become a great action film   and i use the term loosely      the edge is pretty much a survival of the fittest film    but taking scream s lead   the edge makes fun of the genre s cliches   and then uses them   though not quite as effectively      charles morse   anthony hopkins   is the main character   a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him    for once   we don t immediately care for the main character    instead   we like bob   alec baldwin     a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles  wife   mickey   elle macpherson     out in the wilderness    they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic    charles  birthday is the same day   and he receives a gold watch from his wife   and a pocket knife from bob    as action films go   these items do have importance to the rest of the story   but quite a bit more than we first expect    soon   however   bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his   personality      charles   bob   bob s assistant steve   harold perrineau     and the pilot head off to find him   and as shown in the previews   hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter    down the plane goes   the pilot is killed   and the three are left to survive in the wilderness    director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow   and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations    he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film    take   for instance   the entire man hunting bear plot    this has been done many times in films with different animals   and even bears    but given the charles  intelligence   and bob s uncertainty   many of the cliches are given fresh twists    even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before    my favorite line of the film comes from charles     most people die in the wilderness because they didn t do the one thing that could save their life        thinking      despite the predictability of the main plot   a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise   and made me smile when i realized that everything isn t as it seems anymore    i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise   so instead i will avoid it entirely    the first two thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along   and some of charles  survival techniques seem possible   even making fire from ice    tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear   but whenever the bear is present   the characters lose all sensibility    i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water    why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across    i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while    thankfully   we already have begun to care for the characters   and so we let this small detail slide    but some of the technical details are awkward   such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make   where did they get thread and needles        the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature   and borders on phenomenal    anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance   creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day    hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles   but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences  sympathy   something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs    alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen   it sure is better from his fair game      baldwin can be a good or a bad character   and here he succeeds at both in a way    you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end   and baldwin is able to handle the double natured photographer    elle macpherson gives a good performance   albeit slight    she isn t in the film all that much   but for the scenes she does have   she handles as an actress   not as a model    harold perrineau is a good actor   and his scenes are nice and underplayed    he is eliminated early   and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable    the edge is rated r for graphic violence   some gore   and language    some of the violence is a little too disturbing   even for me    this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to   but too many cliches bog it down    director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts    david mamet s script   though   has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat   and the acting is solid    the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn t end with the normal high strung action sequence   but with a small detail involving a certain gift    it s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear    and by the way   most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear    way to go   bart    
1824	1	after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction   jackie brown seems like something of a light hearted departure for quentin tarantino    it s more of a ho hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language    luckily   his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen   and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer    the story introduces us to a street wise black woman named jackie brown   pam grier     a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another    she works for a bottom of the barrel airline and receives a minimal salary    but one day   she is picked up by a pair of federal officials   including michael keaton as the tough nosed ray nicolet     and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope    jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell   samuel l   jackson     who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation    soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle  500   000 through to them under nicolet s nose   with the help of ordell s oaf of a partner   robert de niro   and drugged out lady friend   bridget fonda      also entering the picture is a bail bondsman named max cherry   robert forster     who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated   how i won t say      the big drop off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown   in which numerous double crosses take place and many clothing store bags   filled with cash   switch hands    it s unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there   and doesn t offer anything extremely compelling while doing so    there are   as always   amusing exchanges between characters    the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda   as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq   or lack thereof    the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie    a 56 year old white bail bondsman and a 44 year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry    you ve got to commend the acting    jackie brown is a seriously dragged out exercise enlivened by such fine acting    the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours   35 minutes    tarantino s talky style manages to hold your attention heavily   but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline    also   fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear    jackie brown has four major shootings   and two of those take place mostly off screen   so don t be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath    you can expect frequent foul language   mostly coming way of ordell   who   much to the dismay of spike lee   uses the  n  word as part of his regular vocabulary    the acting is the glue that holds everything together    grier   making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970 s   is more than adequate for the title character    in fact   she s flat out great    another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster   who does a grand job as max cherry   and is perfectly cast in doing so    michael keaton makes his presence felt   albeit in small but dignified moments   and de niro is ideal in playing the lug head who goes over the edge    speaking of that   bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell s bikini clad beach babe   and yet she manages to look fairly occupied    there s not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie    which is a life saver for mr   tarantino    the story barely holds together in the meantime   and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake    but oh well    jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino   even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work    let s just hope that the director hasn t gone soft on us    
18	0	i m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone    sure   she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god s green earth   second only to that movie critic at large guy     but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in   she always strikes out    the crush was a slow moving   predictable piece of fluff    hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in    clueless was an annoying   unfunny waste of time    and people have e mailed me too   saying clueless is a good movie and that i m the only one who doesn t like it    one girl said if i d seen the movie with   an open mind     i would have enjoyed it    nothing could be further from the truth    i went into the theater expecting to love the movie    the preview looked good and of course i m crazymadinlove with alicia   but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny   unlikable characters    almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way    when we were walking out of the theater   one guy   and it wasn t me   yelled out     that was the worst f   in  movie i ve ever seen   and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement    so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia s pretty face on the cover of some made for video thriller called the babysitter    i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway    what i got was 90 minutes of regret  the worst alicia silverstone movie ever    and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like    where to begin in criticizing this movie    the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier   the writing could have been done   and for all we know it was   by a ten year old   alicia is the star and she s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever    there is zero humor   zero suspense   zero drama and zero action   until the last ten minutes   when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence    zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero    so why does this movie get one star out of me    well   alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub    and if it wasn t bubble bath   the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four  star features   but you settle for what you can get    alicia plays a babysitter who s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party    and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home   at least that movie critic at large guy does      as the movie trods along   we discover she s not only the mostly silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character s fantasies   and probably every male viewer s too      the drunken father thinks she s just the thing to recapture his lost youth   her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside   even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she s taking her bubble bath    they even throw in the middle aged wife s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party    not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200  pound woman in a black silk teddy    at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg rated    in fact   i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late night staple if not for the fact that there s absolutely no nudity in it    so you can t call it a sex flick    i ve already pointed out that it can t fall under drama   comedy   thriller or action   so what do you classify the babysitter as    bad    
1549	1	steve soderbergh s   sex   lies   and videotape     which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989   arguably began the resurgence of independent films    made on a shoestring budget of  1   2 million   with then relatively unknown actors   it is a provocative   thoroughly original drama    the film mostly focuses on the four central characters   all in their late 20 s early 30 s    ann   andie macdowell     an unfulfilled housewife   is married to john   peter gallagher     an insensitive lawyer   who   unbeknownst to her   is having an affair with her younger sister   cynthia   laura san giacomo      complicating matters even worse is graham   james spader   who won best actor at cannes     john s old college buddy   who comes to stay at their house    ann is absolutely won over by him   even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex    that is the set up for the last hour of the picture   and since the film is entitled     sex   lies   and videotape     it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise    director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker   ranging from the independent   to the mainstream   1998 s   out of sight       to the downright kafkaesque   1997 s   schizopolis        he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances   and believes in the work that he does   and     sex   lies   and videotape     is probably his most confident   and maybe even best   to date    the performances are superb from all four leads   but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character    she is always a very winning actress   but this is probably her most three dimensional role that she has had   with a close second being altman s 1993 mosaic     short cuts        the other parts are perfectly cast as well   from spader s ominous graham   to gallagher s self involved john   to giacomo s outspoken cynthia    the final act of the film   especially   comes right out of left field   and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching   and it would be criminal to give away the film s secrets    suffice to say that   through one powerful sequence   ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell   and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty   as well as deception    the film has one fault   however    the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another   and often unlikable    if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher   it probably would have helped   since his relationship with macdowell isn t quite as explored as i would have liked       sex   lies   and videotape     although minorly flawed   is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film    soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it   and the final product certainly proves this    
175	0	i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night   but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies    luckily   my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta    i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half faces and poor sound quality   but i couldn t help myself        i got it    well   after watching it   it indeed was a bad print   i was glad i didn t dish out  7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie    this movie really sucks    it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy      for example   how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days    jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail    the songs are bad   the acting is bad   especially deepti bhatnagar s     and the direction is the worst of all    the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up    i didn t even finish the movie        i couldn t take it anymore    note   but if anyone out there liked aatish   by the same director     i guess you d like this movie    it s practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff    aditya panscholi is the sidekick again       i was going to give it a zero   but i personally like jackie shroff   so i loosened up a little    he looked fresh   wore good clothes   as always     and his performance   even though it wasn t his best   was the only saving grace of the movie

597	0	the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what it s about and why it s good or bad    i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this   but i after having seen   get carter   i really can t tell you what it s about although i could go on and on about how and why it s a bad movie       get carter   falls into that category of   movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room    you might call them the   steven seagal mickey rourke jean claude van damme wesley snipes school of mediocre action crime thrillers      you know   the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights   shoot outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development    they have stories where the so called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight   chase or shoot at    sylvester stallone stars as jack carter   a las vegas based mob enforcer who returns home   for his brother s funeral    he believes his brother   richie was   taken out   and didn t die from a dwi accident    carter s one of the most cliche bad asses ever captured on celluloid    his face alone is pretty intimidating and there s quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his   rambo on testosterone therapy   voice    stallone s performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn t realize he s mocking himself    the actual story involves carter s investigation into his brother richie s death    he s in a town that s not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well    mickey rourke co stars as one of these characters   a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon   played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman      there s also another plot involving richie s mistress   a secret cd rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter s still living relatives    i m rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible    i could just rip the screenplay to shreds   plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all    i don t like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally    yes     get carter   is just that complicated and complex    and what s worse is that it s not this intricate to make it seem smart like   the usual suspects   for example   just the opposite    you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn t remember what had already happened and didn t figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax    all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another   asking them what they know   getting information and then realizing that if he wasn t a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes    although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another    making a movie entirely about criminals doesn t necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters    mel gibson starred in   payback   a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldn t help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter    so ultimately   get carter   fails for pretty much every selling point it has    carter is not a likable character and you really don t care if he gets revenge or not    the action sequences are not at all exciting or original    the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all   c mon   you know who s going to win every brawl and shoot out and car chase      in the end you don t feel nearly satisfied with the results    the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible       the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it s seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it s always raining

102	0	warning   spoilers are included in this review        but it doesn t really make much of a difference    deep impact begins the official summer movie season   and it also brings back memories of 1997    remember when dante s peak came out in february    a few months later   volcano was released    the first film was smart   exhilirating   and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen    the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent    well   it s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition    this time   unfortunately   the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon   the upcoming comet disaster to be released the beginning of july    of course   the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine   and so i am in the minority   as i was when i stood on the side of dante s peak    but while watching deep impact   i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film    apparently many did   and it utterly baffles me    to be completely honest   i haven t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life    volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo   but it was still rather fun to watch    deep impact doesn t just have implausibilities   it also contains cheap human drama   incredibly horrible special effects   and a poorly constructed plot    the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters    deep impact begins in an unnamed year   the year varies   advanced technology sets it in the future   but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater   pushing it back to 1993      a line of students is outside at night   peering through telescopes at the dark sky above    among these are leo biederman   elijah wood   and sarah hotchner   leelee sobieski      leo unknowingly discovers a comet   and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer   who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds    he races off to mail the information   but is killed in a reckless car accident    a year passes   and nothing is heard about it again    we are then introduced to jenny lerner   t   a leoni     a reporter for msnbc    she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse   james cromwell      she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie    after talking with rittenhouse   and unsatisfied with the information she gets   she decides to use the internet for help    luckily   she knows exactly how to spell the certain   ellie   that she is looking for   they spell it ele in the film        that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled      before she can use the information   the government decides to push her car off the road    they take her in to meet the president of the united states   president beck   morgan freeman      beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference    naturally   she wants to be compensated   and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question    and so   yada yada yada   they reveal the comet to the public and their plans   send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive    they announce a plan called   ark     which is their only hope for survival    a computer will select 800   000 people at random    these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won t kill off the entire human race    after two years   the dust will settle   actually   it would take much   much longer  approximately ninety years   from what i understand   and the humans could come back to the surface and start over    the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures   but there is one subplot worth mentioning    jenny and her father   jason   maximilian schell     have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom    the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional    it s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt    now   of course   we all know that the comet does impact the surface    the title alone suggests it   and the previews actually show it    by doing this   absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won t work    director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show   er      her major film debut was the peacemaker   a pathetic and heartless action film    well   this time leder outdid herself   creating a film worse than that one    suggestion to ms   leder   please   stay away from the big screen   or at least the action genre    much of the blame can be placed on leder directly   because the pace is disastrously off    throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed   it goes from months to weeks to hours      it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real time  it s that boring    of course   leder isn t all to blame for it    screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time    what starts out promising soon turns deadly   for the audience anyway      chock full of cheesy one liners     you know   you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school        and stupid characters   you might think we were back in the 70s again    only one of the subplots is remotely interesting   while the rest are forgettable and boring    and the main plot is so outrageous that you can t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action   drama   or sci fi    to put it simply   the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation    that s right   80  miss   and 20  hit    scenes above the earth are well done   and the orbiting ship is majestic    but the comet is a huge mistake   making it more laughable than frightening    the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough   but that s forgiveable    what isn t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface    give me a break   will ya    and of course   the much hyped collision of comet and earth    well   it is far from spectacular   and it makes independence day look brilliant    the water rushing towards the land is effective   but once it hits the continent   the effects turn ridiculous    cgi water is used   and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks    in fact   i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days    just when we think visual effects can t be improved   along comes a film to show that they really can and should be    one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder s direction   which also influences the actors    leder loves to show the actors  faces before and during moments of terror    this reminded me of another action director   renny harlin   die hard 2   cliffhanger      but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations    leder likes to flaunt people s fears via their faces   but instead of coming off as sympathetic   leder seems more of a sadist    one moment has an astronaut flying off into space    this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience   but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person s face while drifting into space    this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience   and i   for one   am not going to be fooled    on another note   leder s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts    the pace does pick up   and some very emotional moments are shown    then again   when you watch people cry for their loved ones   it s obvious it will be emotional    it s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into   feeling   for the characters   but it didn t work for me    but anyway   the actors do as much as they can with what they are given    t   a leoni   bad boys   tv s   the naked truth     is the best of the film   and she is given the meatiest role    her character is made stronger by leoni s presence   and we grow to care for her    robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch   but his character is turned into shreds by the plot    elijah wood also comes off rather successfully   but he still hasn t had many good roles   wood   stick to drama    you are too talented for this stuff      vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable   and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen    maximilian schell is distracting   but he does provide some nice humor    morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this   and gives one of his most shallow performances to date   which is quite remarkable for him      leelee sobieski could have been better   but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character    a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby    eldard is good in his role   but is limited by the plot    crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv s   star trek   the next generation      seeing her was one of the highlights of the film    overall   a very talented cast virtually wasted    deep impact is rated pg 13 for disaster related elements and brief language    this is one of the worst films of the year   and if it is any omen of things to come   this summer could be one of the worst ever    luckily   the x files movie is coming up   and hopefully armageddon will be more successful    it s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn t worth much    costing nearly  75 million   with special effects done by the illustrious ilm   which is a huge shocker     and with a score composed by oscar winner james horner   titanic     one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience    well   it s not    when the comet does hit the earth   you almost wish it could just take this film along with it

1562	1	oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with    in a perfect world     a civil action   would be a breath of fresh air    it s cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn t    it s romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book film isn t    and   the capper   it has no distinct ending   and the law in hollywood films is that above all else   you must have an ending    even if it s based on a true story   a true story which hasn t yet ended   you must supply an ending   a false one   but an ending nevertheless    hell     a civil action   is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together   and that includes   the firm     the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic      yet it s also oddly and slightly unsatisfying    weird    this is   in fact   a steve zallian film   not just the work of a hack   and zallian is the director of the much admired   search for bobby fischer     didn t see it   and writer of none other than   schindler s list      in short   i like this guy   and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories    after all   apart from the obvious it s a holocaust film and it s a spielberg film   isn t   schindler s list   just a damn brilliant film   not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study       a civil action   is the same way   it s narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study    and it s here that the film seems to go a bit wrong    the main complaint of this film is that while   yes   it s an engrossing lawyerly tale   it has no real ending   and that s not necessarily the problem with the film    it s that it s just kind of unsatisfying    if this were a great film   it would feel complete   and still end basically the same way    but this film just seems to end   and i don t want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on   imagine   if you will   being one of those the film is about   looking forward to this film   and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter   just so the many won t bitch about what is   essentially   genuine    but the fact that it just ends is not   in all actuality   what is wrong with it    it s rather that zallian has chosen   in the last half hour   to adandon the traditional lawyer story   and chose the other part of his story   the one about the lawyer   one jan schlictman   john travolta     who s shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer   brilliant because he s manipulative and he always wins    it wishes to make it all about jan in the end   but the truth is   his change   although nicely done   is not full    we see him suffering from a personal crisis   and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart   but in the end   we don t fully believe it    and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision   the film choses an odd angle to go at   a noble one   but one that gives the film s conclusion that of incompleteness    in the opening of the film   we see him doing his old schtick   manipulating courts   winning cases effortlessly   and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases    in short   he s full of bullshit and we know it    in the film   he takes a case that is hardly desired   a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river    point one   it s not of the usual criteria   jan points out   wickedly   that dead or wounded children aren t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success      point two   it has been through several lawyers    after turning them down   jan changes his mind   a muddled scene   he stops his car on a bridge   looks out       is he feeling a sense of overachievement       and he and his team of lawyers   tony shalhoub   zeljko ivanek   and accountant william h   macy   head out to the town to do battle with the town s company    they spend millions of dollars examining the land   test the water   what have you   this is where stephen fry   a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in   wilde     pops up thanklessly     and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children   and then   unsuccessfully   the workers at the plant    they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company   the eccentric jerome facher   played by robert duvall   more on him later on      as we progress   we get so involved in the way the story is being told   which is engulfing everything around it   including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople   one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland   who lost her child   who begins to have a personal crisis      things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half   as they are up against impossible odds   the judge   john lithgow   is not only a strickler   but a pal of facher   the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify   no concrete evidence is being found   depsite the money spent to find it   and they are quickly running out of money    as macy mortgages everything he can   including their homes and their office   he slowly loses his sanity   his meatiest role since   oh     fargo       and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist    in fact   the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par   owen gleiberman   especially   criticized the film for not being overly dramatic       i  suppose like a grisham novel      this wouldn t be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is   instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good   he s seen as being still full of bullshit    because he doesn t take stock in the cares of his partners   and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town   he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out    the final half tries to redeem this   as must have been the point of making this in zallian s mind   but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs   and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he s seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him   and thusly receiving two speeding tickets     we still feel that the big change in his life is that he s not rich and esteemed anymore   the film s final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow      the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case   it s still going on   you know     but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has    we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life   and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life    it only feels like half of that    maybe even less    and it s not travolta   who does a great job here   though never to be a truly memorable performance of his     but rather zallian   whose final chapter needs a rewrite    up to then   though   it s an engrossing drama   one of the best of the year in fact   and one of the best lawyer films   period    the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted   but rather it s about the lawyers   the knights who battle eachother    we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town   but the reason it can t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find    and duvall s facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is    facher is seen as an elderly man   a goofy eccentric   carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it   eating lunches out of paper bags   and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio   and scold anyone who interupts him    but look deeper and you see a master at work   his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him   and it s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way    that s why i liked this film   it s hard to put a pointer on    you can never see exactly where this film will land   and even when the credits roll   you still aren t sure what to make of it    call it the zallian effect    same thing happened with   schindler s list     not that i m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman      each film is so greatly crafted that you can t help but get involved in its broad storytelling   interesting characters   and   most peculiarly   the wit that comes along with it    if only it felt totally complete   like   say     schindler s list     though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two     it might have been one of the best films of the year   and along with that   a full breath of fresh air    
1141	1	one of the last entries in the long running carry on series   carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a  caravan  site    professors anna vrooshka   elke sommer   and roland crump   kenneth williams   and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep   kenneth connor   so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains    anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick     for instance   when anna is asking for  scrubbers for dirty caravan    she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan    arthur upmore   bernard bresslaw   and his wife linda   patsy rowlands   take her mother daphne barnes   joan sims   and her minah bird on holiday with them    mother in law jokes prevail    furthermore   the trouble that joe and norma baxter   ian lavender and adrienne posta   have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families    fred ramsden   windsor davies   and ernie bragg   jack douglas   leave their wives   liz fraser and patricia franklin   behind for a fishing holiday    however   they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls   sandra   carol hawkins   and carol   sherrie hewson      the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day to day running of the camp   the search for the minah bid and greyhound   the major   fred and ernie s desperate need of a woman   a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park s pub   and a shock in store for daphne    the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing    this is what binds the movie together    joan sims stands out as the demanding mother in law   bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife   and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast    on the other hand   there are low key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman   and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen    even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman   there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors    although the regular cast is depleted   the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film    a relative flop at the cinema   this movie deserves a lot more recognition    
50	0	sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality    he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades   like twelve angry men   serpico or the verdict    but   in the same time   almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet s reputation    a stranger among us   1992 rip off of peter weir s witness   belongs to the latter category    the heroine of this movie is emily eden   melanie griffith     tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york    during one of such actions   her partner nick   jamey sheridan   got hurt and as a result   she becomes depressed    in order to help her recover   bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community    emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder    concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community   she decides to go undercover    that isn t easy   because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways    things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel   eric thal      using peter weir s formula isn t the greatest flaw of this film    even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent    but the worst insult to viewer s audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith    the author of this review never liked this actress very much   but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles    role of emily eden   unfortunately   isn t one of them    first of all   she can t pass for tough nypd street fighter   and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn t much better    screenplay by robert j   avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots   scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch      but   on the other hand   other actors are more convincing   lee richardson as an old rabbi   thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride     and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community    also   the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture    that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time

1508	1	much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of   lolita     made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made   over its use of pedophilia   and as such   it s important to address it straight forwardly   before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed   as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years   lying around in vaults san a distributor   and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit    when seeing this film   after all the hoopla   keeping in mind that there are people   namely me   who are fans of the novel   who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation       well    you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution    what s even worse is that seeing this   lolita     especially the first time and if you re familiar with anything   lolita     is admittingly very anticlimactic    this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film   ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it   it s really quite a film   perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne   although   really   look at its competition     flashdance       fatal attraction     and   indecent proposal       at least besides   jacob s ladder      i ve seen this   lolita   twice   the first time   i wasn t so blown away    it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting    the second time   not really thinking about how i ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre   it really affected me emotionally    the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one   which is why it s such a good novel   and why this is such a good film    the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14 year old girl named dolores a   k   a   lolita is great because it s not trash for the perverted but because it s about human obsession with things that are out of one s reach    its protagonist   the comically named humbert humbert   is not your average pedophile   but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies    the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology   something that will destroy us but that we can t live without    these ideas are all worked into this film nicely   but done in a way that is not heavy handed at all   but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating    the focus of this film   and the reason for making it   it seems   was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images   and scenes which are blatantly over stylized    the tone of the book is a comical one   but it s also a tragic one   and humbert   telling the story from his perspective   blows every single thing out of perspective    humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires   and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed    we get a sense that perhaps it s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed    he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14 year old love   and allows himself to embody her as lolita    he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions   and by the end   he has nothing but overly dramatic feelings for her    the story recognizes the extreme of this   almost out of a test   seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert   and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author   vladimir nabokov   wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions   and perhaps bring them to peace    the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end   when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey   we can easily sympathize and even identify with him    the opening and final images of the film are the same   and who hasn t done a similar action   that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us    this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen   the first time being filmed in   shock   1962   by stanley kubrick   who couldn t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do   but did the next best thing   he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general    in that film   he used the traps of society as benefits    the studio demanded the final scene   that of a heinous murder   come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile       and  when you see it   it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession    the censors wouldn t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the   um   relationship between humbert and lolita   so kubrick decided to play it as comedy   but still allow the tragedy to seep through    looking at these two versions   especially after reading the novel   and we all know that when we ve read a novel and see a film adaptation   we are bound to be angered by any size differences     it s really impossible to compare them    they both go for different things   and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was    and although it s true that several scenes are similar   and are thus up for comparison   overall it s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse    i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is   and i won t say that here    however   this film is pretty amazing   mostly because hey   i loved the book   and this film nearly reminded me of it    it doesn t have nearly as much wit   a couple comical scenes   and even a lot of good chuckles   but just not totally witty     but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had    some of that is in the casting of the two leads    jeremy irons   with his deep   soft british voice and gentle look   is an amazing humbert    he s droll in a very unique way   and   well   no one can look distraught the way he does    he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience    and when he looks at lolita with love   and she looks at him with lust   you know that he s her prisoner for as long as he lives    and dominique swain   who plays the title character   is rather incredible    she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original   wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction   bratiness   and self centeredness that marks the character    it s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert   she loves the attention   and knows that she can have her way with him at any time    when he denies her something   she blackmails him effortlessly   a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic     and when he stands up to her   she weeps and runs away   leaving humbert to follow her    there are two other minor characters in the film   one who s a road block in the beginning   and the other who s a reappearing threat to the relationship    the former is charlotte   lolita s mother   played by melanie griffith    in the book   charlotte is a monster of a woman   overbearing   constantly scolding her child   overly religious   and ultimately selfish    and she s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal   at least in the beginning    as played by shelly winters in the original   she represented all these qualities   as played by griffith here   she s about half of them    it s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first    and even though griffith is not really bad   persay   she s nothing more    the other is clare quilty   the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita   and succeeds   but at a price    langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original    quilty was a comic character in the original   a threat in the form of many forms   popping in states of rambling   german   proning   and eventually drunk    langella takes the other route   allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed   and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots   and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending   the exact opposite of what we thought of him    as you can see   most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter   stephen schiff   but just parts of a whole new look at the novel   at least cinema wise    this version is beautiful   and perpetually saddening    the camera movements are stylized   and each shot is breathtakingly rich    the acting is for the most part wonderful   and when we watch it   we really get a sense that for humbert   who is telling the story   the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita    more importantly   it takes us right up the brink of emotion   then jumps right over it    by the end   with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car   following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn t regret   we feel that we all lose to something we can never have

1620	1	director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days   terry gilliam comes to mind as another one      film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story   but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something    but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story    so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential   the film almost automatically deserves a good review    and when they add a fascinating story to it   you have nearly perfect entertainment    fincher s the game is no exception to this    the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time    fincher hasn t made a film since   seven     his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever    so it is about time he made another film    and what a ride it is    the game isn t quite as powerful as   seven     but in some ways it is better    overall   the game could have used a little more clarity   or a little more uncertainty    it walks a line of insanity and reality   but it never goes either way until the very end    the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events   and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight    unfortunately   unlike   the usual suspects     we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening   whether it be true or false    however   this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent    the game is told completely from its main character s point of view    nicholas van orton   michael douglas   is a high strung and isolated businessman    he lives alone in his giant mansion   divorced from his wife elizabeth   and is celebrating his 48th birthday   the same age at which his father committed suicide at   in the same mansion    for his 48th birthday   conrad   sean penn     the rebel of the family   gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs   consumer recreation services       it will make your life fun again     his brother promises    as skeptical as nicholas is   he is somewhat intrigued   and annoyed by the lack of information  something this businessman hates    seeing a billboard in an office   he decides to visit the mysterious company    jim feingold   james rebhorn   greets nicholas and guides him through the sign up process   which consists of psych tests   physicals   emotional responses   and other mind games       each game is suited to each person s emotional and psychological needs     explains feingold    one day   nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests    even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up   he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company    what he doesn t realize is that the game has already begun    the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas  way    how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive    the detail involved in fincher s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them    with   seven     fincher had almost every single shot mean something    he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to    compared to   seven     though   the game is light and comical    because of this film s sense of humor and self awareness   nothing can be taken quite seriously    so don t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game   because it doesn t want you to    what does make sense is the final revelation  when everything becomes apparent and clear    if taken as it is   the game s ending makes complete sense    but if you try and critique every minute detail   then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility    perhaps that is the reason i docked the film    while trying to remain realistic and plausible   the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen    we don t really care if douglas  character lives or not because it isn t believable    the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously   but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is   you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller    michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas    douglas has played lonely businessmen before   but here he adds another level to his performance    his character   who is normally level headed and relies on facts   is forced to trust nobody    can he believe the waitress he bumped into    what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place    douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well   and gives one of his best performances   even better than his   falling down   persona      the supporting cast is essential in this film   and casting was critical    sean penn is always good   and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas  brother    deborah kara unger   from   crash     is the waitress he bumps into   and her performance is extremely good    in fact   she almost steals the film from douglas    james rebhorn portrays his character very well   and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas  predicament    another good performance comes from armin mueller stahl   from   shine     as the book editor    but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game   he not only commands this cast   but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life    the game is rated r for language   violence   some gore   and some nudity and drugs    what is essential for this film to work is the writing    john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue   and some very funny moments    this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects  did    however   the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot    and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen   you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year s best films    
1429	1	it s wednesday   march 27   and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte   south carolina    the crime   a young prostitute   elizabeth   renee zellweger     has been brutally slain    one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station    the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority   miles away    the police duo of braxton   chris penn   and kennesaw   michael rooker   are strapped for leads    at the moment   they have only one possible suspect   wayland   tim roth     a wealthy   unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act    that s the premise for deceiver   a new thriller from the pate brothers   jonas and josh   who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave    deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not  so bright cops   captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland s iq is 151   by contrast   kennesaw s is 122 and braxton s is 102      the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered    over three days   as wayland returns to answer more questions   the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until   inevitably   it boils over    other plot elements are thrown in for good measure    wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can   in stressful situations   render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent    braxton   a compulsive gambler   is deep in debt to a local syndicate    and kennesaw is haunted by a dark   abusive side that delights in terrorizing women   especially his wife   rosanna arquette     whom he suspects of being unfaithful    the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth s death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand   the suspect or his questioners    deceiver   which mostly transpires in a dimly lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue   has the feel of a david mamet play   edgy   claustrophobic   and tense    the atmosphere is explosive   and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting    deceiver has the power to grab an audience    unfortunately   in the end   it succumbs to the need to throw in one last   unexpected twist   and this is its undoing    for   while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers   it also stretches our credulity too much   and raises more questions than it answers    it s only an effective wrap up if you don t think too carefully about its full implications    of course   the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic    police procedure is totally ignored and it s almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner    but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction   not plot details    deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station   and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute    the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth s final days and hours    the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice over by visually showing what really happened    moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks    the movie   obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir   drips atmosphere    there are some fascinating stylistic touches   for example   although the setting is contemporary   all of the telephones are old fashioned   rotary models    cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver s look    some of the things he tries   mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow   work exceptionally well   while others   like any of several lazy susan shots   seem more like unnecessary visual tricks    as wayland   tim roth gives the film s top performance   despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting    roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he s supposed to be    the other two leads   chris penn and michael rooker   aren t as effective    both play their characters like familiar types    penn s performance is uninspired   rooker s lacks subtlety    some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors    renee zellweger   in a role that s miles away from her star making turn in jerry maguire   brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature    rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw s wife   and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who s entrusted with evaluating wayland s condition    one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience    plot points aren t hammered home   and   although the ending has its weaknesses   everything isn t spelled out in bold letters    the pates give audience members credit for having brains   which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers    occasionally gripping and never uninteresting   deceiver is a fine noir effort    
411	0	capsule   this super light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems    the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television    the characters are paper thin and the interesting ideas purely non existent    this is a decrement life by 90 minutes card       0    4 to  4    jalla   jalla    is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen    it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love    the film is set in sweden where roro and mans   fares fares and torkel petersson   are custodians at a public park   roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely   mans is a swede from a much more liberal background    they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park   cleaning up after dogs    roro and mans each have girlfriends   but each has a problem    roro   nicknamed   jalla     is having family problems    it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman   yasmin   laleh pourkarim     but he is already in love with lisa   tuva novotny      yasmin likes roro   but does not want to get married either    mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence    the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other    mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers    the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them    roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other   but then plan to break up before the wedding    not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected    the plot turns in several places are contrived    one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen    lebanese born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer    when things start to get slow   he just adds throws in another story    for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film    characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function    we do see some of roro s family life and his concerns    that may be because roro s background is a lot like that of the director    while the story was entertaining   i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film    it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life    one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this    i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to  4 scale

746	0	talk about beating a dead horse    when home alone was released in 1990   it was a breath of fresh air   and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely funny family film    the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel   so   two years later   we were subjected to home alone 2   which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited    for john hughes   two home alone movies weren t enough   he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with   including a pathetic box office bomb called baby s day out   last year s live action 101 dalmatians   and this year s flubber    now   inexplicably   hughes has exhumed not only these worn out plot elements   but the   home alone   name as well    the result   1997 s worst sequel   edging out speed 2 and batman and robin     home alone 3    by changing the characters   hughes   who wrote and co produced the film     along with his co conspirator   director raja gosnell   has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest    the new kid   alex pruitt   is played by alex d   linz   one fine day     and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness    he s not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was    the villains   pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern   are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber    in home alone 3   there are four of them   olek krupa   david thornton   lenny von dohlen   and rya kihlstedt     but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls    this time   the kid isn t left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip    instead   he has developed a bad case of chicken pox   so he can t go to school    his dad   kevin kilner   is away on business and his mom   haviland morris   has to run errands   so   for the most part   he s all by himself during the day    through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate   a top secret u   s   air force integrated circuit comes into his possession    it s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex s home to retrieve it    the eight  year old   who is wise beyond his years   booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains    the movie s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm   only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable    previously   the most counterfeit looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii    these are far worse    in fact   the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near blizzard when a shining sun can be seen    if it s a wonderful life could generate real  looking snow back in the 1940s   why can t home alone 3   which has a significantly larger budget and  90s technology at its disposal    there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live action cartoon violence for young children    home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire    it s one thing to see wyle e   coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight   but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen    adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous   but what about five and six year olds    the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme   many of alex s schemes are nasty enough to kill    but   because this is a   family film     no one dies   despite being electrocuted   falling thirty feet   and getting smacked on the head by a barbell    not only is home alone 3 unnecessary   but it s offensive    it s an exercise in tediousness   and there isn t a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end   unless   by some strange quirk of fate   you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes   and thus haven t seen this stuff before      i can t imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure    maybe that s why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb sucking years    
1438	1	contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan s only novel    it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway   jodie foster      we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico   where she is part of the seti   search for extraterrestrial intelligence   project    her research is quickly killed   however   by her highly political david drumlin   tom skerrit     who disdains   pure research   in favor of science with   commercial applications    she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s   r    hadden   john hurt      then   with that money just about to finally dry up   ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal    in the movie s most exciting and believable sequence   ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega    at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers   then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before    further decoding   with hadden s help   reveals another layer to message   containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine    it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens  home world    of course   the big question becomes   who gets to ride it         right after   who s gonna pay for this thing          to boil it down   ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism   while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith    drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform   apparently to keep   godless science   from talking to god   or something like that      then hadden reappears with startling news    he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie   in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest    ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels   where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father   david morse      when she returns home   no one believes her    she was not even gone for one second   they say   even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours    her story is officially discredited   although believed by a large segment of the public   who don t even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static            eighteen hours worth of static      there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first    ellie arroway is a well rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working    neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs   but that s a tough standard to meet    ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures    her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally    drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble    hadden obviously has affection for ellie   but in the end he seems to see her as his creation   nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board    even palmer joss   matthew mcconaughey     ellie s love interest   takes a paternalistic interest in ellie   seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses    the film is technically impressive   especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine    the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain    the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme   the dichotomy between science and religion    this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved    the film presents science pretty well   until the end   so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith    religious people are presented as shallow caricatures    rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank   very subtle   guys     the voice of the religious right    another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine   jake busey      the only really fleshed out religious person   palmer joss   is supposed to be a minister of some sort   but his actual faith is left pretty vague    i can t even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian    all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre marital sex    the film drops the science ball at the very end   when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith    in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist   religious   doctrine   this is exactly the wrong message to send    in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith   the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism    what ellie should have said was     you shouldn t believe me    not without evidence   and i don t have the evidence    i know what happened but you shouldn t take my word alone      that is the voice of science speaking    the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film    his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position    also   his profession of   faith   before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it    the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles    the media figures   such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren t so bad   in as much as their participation was voluntary    the use of bill clinton   however   should give anyone pause    first of all   lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line   thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken   is just plain creepy    also   using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001   forever dating it    people watching this film in the future will say     hey   this never took place during clinton s term      this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief    also   the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century    better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all    the film does raise an interesting question   although it never develops it in a satisfying way    if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture   would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god   or at least some form of supernatural creator    personally   i would hope not   since religion is basically an opinion   a form of ideology    i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task    
1073	1	zero effect gets its title from the main character   daryl zero   bill pullman     although we don t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film    zero is a private investigator   perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived   at least he d like to think so      however   he s a socially inept being   and eccentric in every possible way    this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are    zero s accomplice is steve arlo   ben stiller     a   normal   guy who does the business side of the job    he s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero s greatness as an investigator    the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero s talents to soon to be client gregory stark   ryan o neal      it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box   and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about    zero takes the case   and the plot thickens    his path leads to a young   pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan   kim dickens      despite her luminous and seemingly harmless presence   she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark    through his investigations   zero learns why   but not without developing feelings for gloria    feelings that   because of his reclusive behavior   are new and confusing to him    i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film    i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators   and   every once in a while   a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away   actually   no private eye film has ever reached chinatown s greatness      zero effect   which is jake kasdan s first effort as writer director   is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts   it s an original   funny   and completely involving motion picture    with so many cliches available to this genre   i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them    but he didn t just successfully avoid flaws   he has created a great film here   one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment    take   for starters   the great cast of characters    pullman is terrific as zero   showing a comic flair that i really haven t seen from him since spaceballs    zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here   the fact that he s an almost exaggeratedly twisted   emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe    pullman s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance   and the occasional voice over as he s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious    ben stiller is also a very funny individual   he s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny       i ll shoot you     he says to stark at one point       i have a gun   and everything      his character is also well drawn   with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend   angela featherstone   who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job    o neal also gives his character a bit of depth   and kim dickens   last seen   and underused   in mercury rising   gets a chance to show us her talent here   giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs    i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film    kasdan s humor is of the best kind    soft spoken   and mostly dialogue driven   though there are some great visual jokes      it s the kind of humor that s funny even after you ve seen it five or six times    there s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is   an how that makes him such a great detective    what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed   or standing motionlessly   with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face   his eyes pointing to something off camera   but obviously to nothing in particular    i can t convey to you how funny this is   but what makes it great film making is that it has a point    scenes like this are frequent   and they provide solid characterization of zero    as a side note   i don t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy   not to sound elitist      i find things funny that many do not   and vice versa    there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film   and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it    i have a feeling the humor here won t appeal to everyone   but there s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone s interest    jake kasdan   son of writer director lawrence kasdan   is only 22 years old    i found this out after seeing the film   and i can t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker    his direction is stylish without being pretentious   and his writing is mature   full   and developed    zero effect is the kind of film that i ll buy for my collection    smart   original films like this are rare as it is   but this one actually has a heart and a soul    at the end of the film   i was involved in the characters   and i was satisfied with the outcome    and   with kasdan s undeniable talent at such a young age   all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future    
88	0	lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4   episode 1 is a boring   empty spectacle that features some nice special effects    after the familiar  a long time ago            opening   the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game    the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo   ruled by queen amidala   portman   jedi knights qui gon   neeson   and obi wan   mcgregor   are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade    however   this simple blockade is not all it seems   and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers   including facing the evil darth maul   ray park      they also meet the future darth vadar   anakin skywalker   jake lloyd    star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking   script   direction and characters    the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic    the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star   and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non existent    there s no underlying tension   and no urgent need to see what the outcome is    the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story   which doesn t help    there s no snap to make the film work   it moves at a plod    the script is boring   all the characters speak in morals   especially anakins mother    there s no group spirit evident here   and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders   it s evident that not much is going to happen    the two leads are hideously boring   static characters given little to do and too much time to do it    qui gon and obi wan hold no presence on film   and give little for the audience to root for    the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul   if he had been given more screen time    maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history   even if he does provide the only  straight  plot line in the film   all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy      anakin is annoying and unlikeable      instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended    it s probably not surprising that his hateful little boy   unfortunately blessed  ani  by everyone he knows   joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible    the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks   although in the end none is provided in the film by him    although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys   the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny    the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a  pod  racer   because i knew he wouldn t be able to talk for a while    queen amidala is a nothing in the film   she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must  serve her people     and go goo goo over anakin    again   her role will become more important in the later episodes   and is given little to do here    the actors don t help the movie much either    liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed   and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible    mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy   with little charm    the casting director must have chose him because he s scottish like alec guinness   there s little other explanation for it    natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script   but she delivers a spunky performance    and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice    there s very little talent evident with him   it s hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there    he s not even very  cute      the main claim of the film   the special effects   are okay    there s nothing impressive about them   yet they complement the story well    the cgi takes away much of the human element   however    the battle droids for example   the replacement for the stormtroopers   are characterless little computer graphics   lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers    episode 1 is just disappointing    it s got high production values   but little else    the music is meandering   except near the end    the plot gives us no one to root for   or even care for    the effects are nice   but dull    the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should    there s an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair   and many clich   s are catered for throughout the film    apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence   episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose   except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film    disappointing is barely the word    rating

34	0	hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell    the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films    in a nutshell   the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous    with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership   a lot of hong kong s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u   s   productions    such talents as jackie chan   rush hour     chow yun fat   anna   the king   the corrupter   and yuen woo ping   the matrix   have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results    now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai    unfortunately   romeo must die   bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong s rhythms    the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking    enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing   russell wong      kai confronts po sing   jon kit lee     the son of kai s boss and leader of the local chinese family    a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai   who handily kicks and punches his opponents down    it s not until club owner silk   rapper dmx     bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends    the following morning po sing is found dead    suspicions escalate   as issac o day   delroy lindo   is told of the murder    his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture    issac implores his chief of security   mac   issiah washington   to watch after his son and daughter    the scene shifts to a prison in china   where han sing   jet li   learns of his brothers murder    he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined    hung upside down by one foot   han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work    escaping to the u   s   han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother s death       romeo must die   is in many ways a fun film    it is both absurd and assured    the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes   the godfather      the relationship between jet li s han and aaliyah s trish o day reminds us of abel ferrera s   china girl     except that romeo must die s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another    their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history    the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable    li   of course has the showiest part   having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination    allayah   in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace    it s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic    but   still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it    delro lindo as issac o day carries himself well in the film    an unsung and under appreciated actor   mr   lindo turns out the films best performance    the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d   b   woodside as issac s son   colin    the performance is undirected   with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in    an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and   or better written    first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film    having a career as one of the industry s best cinematographers   bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots   and   romeo must die   does look good    but the pacing of the film is lethargic   only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes    the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in    the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing    and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah s bodyguard   maurice has no comic timing whatsoever    the best things about the film are its fight scenes    jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles    one needs only to see his film   fist of legend   to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat    here   jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that   lethal weapon 4     jet s u   s   debut   didn t allow    unfortunately   a lot of jet s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision    also   romeo must die   must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film   and that is an x ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film   showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent    obviously a homage to the famed x ray scene from sonny chiba s   streetfighter     the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film    it s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted    one problem though about the fight scenes    those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon    they do have an internal rhythm to them    a heartbeat   so to speak in their choreography    the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance    this is created by the performance   the direction and the editing    here in   romeo must die     there is no staccato    every fight scene   even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern    the rhythm is monotonous    a hong kong film has a tempo that changes   heightening its emotional impact     rmd  is limited to a standard 4 4 tempo   not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever    a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan s films      watch the restaurant fight from the film   rush hour   and notice that the context of the fight   while technically amazing is rather flat   the framing and cut always do not help      now look at the warehouse fight from   rumble in the bronx      there you have a heartbeat   and emotional draw that doesn t let the audience catch its breath    the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly   causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted    here in  romeo must die    the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl    jet li is a grand and personable screen presence    it s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here    one day filmmakers here in the u   s   will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity    until then   we ll be left with emotionally hollow product like   the replacement killer   and   currently   romeo must die      
905	0	don t let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare    no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work   and this movie makes a vain attempt at that    any moves to   glamorise  his life   which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do   will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness    this movie about his life   although well written   puts too much make up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes   rather than lobster and champagne    oh well   let s fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play write   who falls in love with a beautiful woman   gwyneth paltrow   and from her inspiration   several plays develop     romeo and juliet    and   the twelfth night     it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that s how all his plays develop   but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama    but i guess my version probably wouldn t draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen    so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare   when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul    i think not    as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie    i think not    in many aspects   private ryan  and   life is beautiful  were far superior movies   but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar   as time and again   for reasons unexplained   an undeserving movie will win the accolade    another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead   over a more polished cate   but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised   people will start feeling sorry for you    
1722	1	it s not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts    but that s just what happened to me at uhf   weird al yankovic s big screen debut    uhf is a television parody a la airplane   and like airplane   the movie is extraordinarily stupid    but it s dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb   it s so silly and outrageous it s hilarious    the movie stars weird al as george newman   a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination   the type who fantasizes he s indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns    george is basically a loser   his daydreams and smart alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks    but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station    george revives channel 62 with innovative programming   shows like   wheel of fish   and movies like   conan   the librarian      as the station s ratings rise   it comes into competition with channel 8   the leading vhf network affiliate    as r   j    fletcher  channel 8 s ill natured   hard nosed owner  veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy   he really hams it up with his snorts   grimaces   and scowls    uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television   including game shows   tabloid talk shows   children s shows   dizzy news women   and movies  everything from rambo to close encounters    the funniest scene   the one that made my head spin   is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed    like most movies in its genre   uhf is hit or miss    for every gag that works   at least one fizzles    for instance   weird al s mock video of   money for nothing   by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt   although it does have some nifty computer animation      but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail   we know another gut wrencher is on the way    in fact   uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane type movie since        well   since airplane    much of the credit goes to weird al s exceptionally inventive script and to the movie s winsome cast    weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning   but because he s not afraid to look silly   he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character    the real standout is michael richards as stanley   the dim witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children s show     stanley spadowski s playhouse      stanley s off beat   mixed up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over night star    he is an endearing mixture of good natured innocence   high energy enthusiasm   and puppy dog cuteness    and above all   he s a good janitor who adores his work    another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips    the cast also features gedde watanabe   the chinese foreign exchange student in sixteen candles   as the karate master who hosts the hit series     wheel of fish      also aboard for the ride is fran drescher   who plays pamela finklestein   channel 62 s roving reporter    unfortunately   as weird al s girlfriend   victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering   whining   and sulking    her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether    while uhf is not an absolute must see   it s definitely the ticket if you re looking for a wild and zany   whacked out comedy    the movie is good enough to see in the theaters   but it may work even better on television   the very medium at which it pokes fun    
726	0	   soldier     by director paul anderson   is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting    the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel s character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision    brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it   and the opening scenes tap into it a little    then it goes nowhere with that idea    there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization   and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i ve ever seen    the whole idea of the inhuman   soldier type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done   and it s been done much better    i was able to predict the plot of the  whole  story   which wouldn t be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting    between the action sequences   it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr   russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes   since his dialog is extremely limited    his performance in that way isn t all that bad   but certainly is not enough to carry this film    other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all   and they generally are about as weak as their characters    but enough of this stuff about plot and character   right    isn t the most important part of an action film   well   the action    even in this aspect the film is a disappointment    in mortal kombat   1995     director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining    however   he fails to repeat that in this film    the combat scenes   particularly the big one at the end   is incredibly unimaginatve    fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie   a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize    but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with   it goes for the old   shoot em up   one guy vs   an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s    if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously   it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film    however   it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that   making the film a big disappointment    
1267	1	one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length    if a film is only 90 minutes   but feels like 300 minutes   then it s crap    but if a film last 2 1 2 hours   and feels like 90 minutes   then it s excellent    boogie nights falls into the latter catagory    the director   anderson   delivers a funny   hip   yet sometimes violent film   which flies along    mark whalberg   a   k   a  marky mark   plays eddie adams   a seventeen year old with a certain  gift  in the midriff area    jack horner   reynolds   is a adult film director   who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business    after running away from home   eddie joins jack   changes his name to dirk diggler   and starts making erotic movies    in the movie business   dirk meets a whole load of characters   which the film introduces very quickly and slickly   such as scotty   phillip seymour hoffman     rollergirl   graham   amber   moore   and floyd   phillip baker hall     and little bill   william h   macy   all the characters are well written   well played   and the audience gets to know them pretty well   thanks to the excellent script    we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce   rollergirls hard time at school   and little bills wife   who sleeps with everyone except her husband    but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing    the direction is fast   thrilling   and never holds up    there are some great shots   some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences   and lots of other neat directional touches    the writing is fabulous   with some intelligent dialogue   some funny dialogue   but none of the dialogue is crap   like most hollywood films   such as the lost world   jurassic park   1997     or tommorow never dies   1997        boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing   on par   and sometimes betters   quentin tarantino s films resevoir dogs   1992   and pulp fiction   1994    the soundtrack is also excellent    like american graffiti   1973     the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack   which heightens the atmosphere   and gives the film an extra lift    also   the costumes are great    the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties    the film   although excellent   does have some flaws    firstly   wahlberg   although excellent   cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry    in both scenes where he has to act angry   his acting is so  off    the scenes tension and anger is lost    but the rest of the cast are excellent    burt reynolds is brilliant   julianne moore shows real emotion   and william h   macy is great aswell   but he always is      another flaw with the film   though   is that the ending seems a bit tacked on    it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit   and needed to wrap up quickly    it s a shame   really   as the rest of the film is perfectly paced    but they re small niggles really    boogie nights is an excellent film    superb directing   writing   acting and music   all combine to make one spectacular film    whatever you do   do not miss out on boogie nights    
1862	1	the verdict   spine chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king   featuring an outstanding   oscar winning performance from kathy bates    geez   french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this    sorry   non british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders   my apologies    the pair are british comediennes   jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in   absolutely fabulous       who did a series of film spoofs a few years back   including alien   the exorcist and misery    needless to say   amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates   the resemblance was quite uncanny       dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder s legs    but despite the lingering memory of their sketch   and although i ve now seen the film a couple of times now   that   hobbling   scene was no less disturbing    i m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion    that may be the most memorable scene   but it s certainly not the only worth watching    stephen king   whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality   strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale    it s a nicely crafted psychological horror   which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon   james caan      rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes   bates     who introduces herself as the writer s   number one fan     he soon becomes her prisoner    both the script and kathy bates  beautifully masterful performance   for which she won an oscar   work arm in arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit cake   or is that fruity as a nut cake        bates relishes her demanding role   and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece    at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour   at times she s a rather tragic character   and more often than not she s just damned scary    this is basically a very simple tale   but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity    it s an involving   engrossing experience   and considering it s basically a two hander   mainly set in one locale   it s a remarkable piece of cinema    there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences   this one relies solely upon rob reiner s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan    oh   i haven t really mentioned caan yet   he does a good job as the writer who s a prisoner of his own success   annie is obsessed with him and his books      but   as you no doubt gathered from the above   bates is well and truly the star of the show    along with the pig   of course    anyway   the tension is built up with masterful aplomb   and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense    there s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve shattering lengths to poison her wine    he succeeds   but       she  knocks the glass over    i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well    in the immortal words of homer j   simpson     d oh        other nerve wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house    we cut to annie in her car   she s on her way home       he  realises this and tries to get back to his room       cut  to the car again   she s getting near       will he make it    ok   so these sequences aren t exactly original   nor perhaps unpredictable   but they work    boy   do they work    if a film has you on the edge of your couch   biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense   then it s doing something right    of course   the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned   hobbling      annie realises her captive has been out of his room   and she s going to stop him once and for all    cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer   and       i feel ill just thinking about it    nasty    it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand   and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho    and then we re given one of the most ridiculously over the top fight scenes i ve ever seen    she gets hit over the head with a typewriter   set on fire   head smashed against the wall   and she just won t die    sheldon isn t in terribly good shape either    if it weren t so gorey it would almost be laughable    but it s a terrifically effective film   and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked    misery is a tight   tense   intense and chillingly entertaining thriller    the directing is first rate   and the performances   bates in particular   contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem    wonderful stuff                                         for more regularly updated film and tv reviews   check out my site    http     www   geocities   com hollywood bungalow 4960                                     
1478	1	one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel    that concept   although many purists doubt its scientific credentials   spawned many interesting novels   comic books and films in the last century    however   the big grand daddy of time travels   h   g   wells  novel the time machine   wasn t written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences    the author   h   g   wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich   idle capitalist class and impoverished labour    whatever intentions wells had   the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages    instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space    the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration    first of them was george pal   who in 1960 directed film which would   through the years   become genre classic of its own    the plot revolves about george   rod taylor     victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension   time    at the eve of the new 20th century   george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention   machine that would enable him to travel through time    they are skeptical   but that doesn t prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future    at first   he travels slowly   seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars    finally   after witnessing world war three   he travels far into the future   hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions    when he finally reaches year 802   701 ad   at first glance   new world looks like utopia   humanity consists of young   beautiful   but idle eloi   people who are fed   clothed and taken care of by unseen machines    but   weena   yvette mimieux     eloi woman   tells george about another side of the coin   in the night   her people is preyed upon by morlocs   humanoid creatures from the underworld    the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature   the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times    for h   g   wells it was frightening threat of class struggle   for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan   who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war   it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust   underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie    even the modern audience   which would be tempted to discard the film as old fashioned   could find some values in its universal messages   fit for each era    compared with the genre films of today   the time machine is even better   and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent   thought provoking films    of course   since this is hollywood product after all   the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure   sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness    for example   it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future   same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters   while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today    some of the final scenes   that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero   are also rather unconvincing    but   on the other hand   the film is very well directed   cleverly paced and the special effects   although definitely old fashioned   are more than adequate for this kind of picture    the acting is good   with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles   while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george s trusted friend filby    yvette mimieux   who plays weena   on the other hand   would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role    however   despite all those flaws   the time machine is a very good piece of cinema   something that connoisseurs of quality science fiction films sorely miss these days    
1313	1	   the celebration   is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant    you know   where you sit down to watch it   and no matter what you ve heard about it before   you just can t help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs    i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like    i don t really feel there are to be any real   rules   for cinema   a film can do anything   as long as it makes it work    but i do ask that all films have one thing in common   they create experiences    when i watch a film   no matter what kind of film it is   i want to be able to take certain memories along with me       the celebration   is great because it s chock full of those    it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life    and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial   just to make sure you re paying attention   which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored   then you re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning up    the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch   henning mortizen     who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him    all his friends and family turn up   and for the first half hour   we get introduced to everyone   simplistically and realistically   no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here      the eldest son   christian   ulrich thomsen   looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell     is the first to be seen in the film   walking to his father s home    his brother   michael   thomas bo larsen     drives by   pulls over   greets him   then kicks his family out of the car   forcing them to walk to the estate   just so christian can be comfortable    we then meet helene   paprika steen     their sister   a woman who always seems to be stressed out   who invites the driver of her car   gbatokai dakinah     an american   to to come join her at the party she s going to    once they re all there and settled in   the party begins   and as custom   the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad   so christian stands up   at the head of the table   and reveals the film s punchline   his father raped all his children at a young age    but since this is a family friends affair   his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth   and is simply brushed off despite his efforts   and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir   and it s all terribly interesting to watch    twists occur   and soon the film has taken on a nearly farsical nature   but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends    the most notorious thing about this film   which has been getting the most notice   though   is that the director   thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion    as a member of the danish filmmakers clan   dogme 95   a group that has vowed to oppose   the auteur concept   make up   illusions   and dramaturgical predictability   so that they may   purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot      i have not seen   breaking the waves     the other notable film by a member of this group   lars von trier   to be exact     but   the celebration   works exquisitely in this department    it feels like reality   like you re actually watching real people and not actors   and as a major pointer   has been shot on video    as a result   it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film   but always wanted to    we see key moments in people s lives that they wouldn t dare show to the world   and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style   as ironically showmanship as it really is   works perfectly for the nature of the film    the key   though   to this film   and the reason it s not just a cool danish import   is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth    throughout the film   we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies   a debate so three dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the truth at all costs reasoning out of the water    of course it was not right for the father to rape his children   and of course   they couldn t have fought back then   and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them    and yes   it s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later   when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier    but then again   the father   after all   is not a totally bad guy   and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier   we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he s done   and deep down   feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface    the final scene   involving mortizen and everyone else   is utterly devastating   thanks to him and thomsen   whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex    everyone else is flawless as well   the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them    the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest   there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays   exactly like life    as such     the celebration   may be the one truly bizarro film of the year   a work of art so eerily close to reality that it s utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating    
1254	1	no humans were harmed   tested or tasted in the making of this film    all recipes are fictions    twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism    a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul    director writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts   but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves             they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive        this true story   briefly mentioned in   the shining     has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture    in 1847   the united states was a land of pioneers   of gold starved americans making their way west    it was a period of manifest destiny   the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries   stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could    capt   john boyd   guy pearce   has become both a   hero   and a victim during this period of relentless consumption        in ways he could never have imagined    boyd s journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost   a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california    upon his arrival he is greeted by a small   motley group of soldiers   including his commanding officer   hart   jeffrey jones     a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life   toffler   jeremy davies     the fort s personal emissary to the lord   knox   stephen spinella     the veterinarian that plays doctor   who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn t like   reich   neal mcdonough     the no nonsense soldier of the group   and the seriously   over medicated   cleaves   david arquette     a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions    into this cold   bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger   colqhoun   robert carlyle     a half starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound    seeking refuge in a cave   they soon ran out of food   and were forced to consume one another    colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d oeuvre himself    our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors   and colqhoun tags along to help out    soon it becomes clear that colqhoun s tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive    it involves an old indian myth called weendigo   which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person s strength   spirit and very essence    his hunger becomes an insatiable craving   the more he eats   the more he wants   and the stronger he becomes    there can never be enough   and death is the only escape      it s all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through    as professionally made as the movie is   you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this    teen age horror fans won t care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell    older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit   but they ll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces    but jokes aside   this is a film that is well worth watching    it has wonderful and mature characters   that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end    the two main characters are also the most interesting    boyd is a simple   honest man tiered of war   killing and fear    his sacred wish is to live a normal   quite life away from gunpowder and blood    colqhoun is different    he proves that a man   on the brink of death   would do anything to stay alive   including sacrificing his own soul    he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically    it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen    the atmosphere in   ravenous   is macabre and bizarre   scary and surreal    completely isolated from the rest of the world   stands fort spencer    here time stands still   and nothing changes    the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage    they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished    men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life    men that are nothing   and has nothing to loose    the result is some sort of cabin fever    cannibalism is more like a sick game for them    since they find no pleasure in living   they find some excitement in killing and dying    it s like   who s going to die first      the unchangeable icy landscape   where birds do not sing and even wind doesn t move the leaves on the trees   resembles kubrick s   the shining      it s hard to not get mad here    one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters   and starts to understand them   although they have turned into half crazed killers    music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere    a strange musical score   composed by michael nyman   the piano   and damon albarn   that often seems out of place   and in complete contrast to the image   somehow reflects the characters  twisted reactions on the world and their situation    the director herself stated that it was   ok to laugh   during the picture    and i must admit that it is often very funny   in a strange way   such as the wonderful quote         it s  lonely being a cannibal    you don t get that many friends          or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin   saying   eat to live    don t live to eat         but  mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change    every actor does a great job    especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal   and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier   nagged by his undeserved honor    this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan s  interview with the vampire     actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies   since the topics are so alike       ravenous   starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale   where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring    however these little failures don t diminish the impression    this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations    it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone s soul   a dark side which we re all trying to hide    but it s there    always    it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since   the shining             i said no food    i didn t say there was nothing to eat            colqhoun   ravenous  
202	0	capsule   the much anticipated re adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting   but very little intelligence    visually there is much to like about this version   but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver s travels and treat it as an action film    that makes it a film without much center       0    4 to  4    pierre boulle   author of the bridge on the river kwai   wrote planet of the apes   a   k   a   monkey planet     the novel   as a social satire    it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver s travels    humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed   not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift s island of the houyhnhnms    the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet    it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals   but perhaps i was just looking for that    when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968   he added a number of serling touches   familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling ish    the final irony of the original version has become film history    without it there could never have been a   planet of the apes   film series    i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language    in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language    that could have been done in the film   but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non ape speaking    serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and   of course   there is some justification for that by the end of the film    justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending    but serling never tackles the all important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language   a language they had no opportunity to ever hear    few viewers questioned this serious plot hole   however   and the film has become well respected in cinema history    partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith s best if not his best    when the film s success called for sequels   the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well intentioned   though not very subtle   political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s    while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half  hearted   by the second film   beneath the planet of the apes   there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases    the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973    now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again    for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book   burton s new version is even less faithful    first   he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes    he has them both be intelligent   articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands   uh   make that paws   of the apes    that could be a good story too   but it is not planet of the apes    as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century   the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring    in 2029 leo davidson   mark wahlberg   not this world s most expressive actor   works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes    then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard of oz fashion and drops him on an alien planet       yes   he survives this storm   but then no storm is perfect      he quickly finds   not greatly to any surprise he shows   that on this planet apes rule and humans drool   but everybody talks    and the language they talk is earth  english    apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that    the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film    both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english    in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human animal relationships and more one of the master slave relationships    outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic    leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari   played by helena bonham carter    ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power    she is bent on making the world a better place    perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil ari    in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout   carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film    she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward    it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes    this is a further abandonment of the source material    the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each s place in this reversed society   each important in the book    we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down    we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them    burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn    this is a miscalculation   as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in    they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win    the 1968 script had little subtlety   with lines like   i never met an ape i didn t like     but at least we cared for what happened to taylor   the main character    most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals    the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog    this tends to limit close looks at the makeup    in general it seems much improved from 1968    the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers   who did it for the 1968 version    in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw dropper    it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion    chambers is good   but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker    today audiences have higher expectations   baker s visualization is really an improvement    these visuals work nicely    what does not work is the wire  assisted leaps some of the apes make    they look like they were inspired by the physics  defying leaps of crouching tiger   hidden dragon    apes spring incredible distances    some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture   but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost    one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close up    since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make up    the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti    it is not that his lines are so good   most are silly jokes    but he delivers them very well    he was always a watchable actor   but has not yet made stardom    as the ape trader limbo he over emotes to overcome his ape make up   but does it very well    in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen    he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov s performance in spartacus    as an in joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself    danny elfman s score has a nice primitive feel   but jerry goldsmith s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic    that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten    i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to  4 scale

1850	1	clint eastwood   in his ripe old age   is cashing one talent in for another    midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood directed film clint isn t even in   and it s damn good    adapted from a best selling john berendt novel based on true events   this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah   where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head    and that s just the mayor    as director and producer   eastwood contributes a self  indulgent but very competent 150 minutes   neatly balancing drama   suspense and humor    like all great movies   midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves   and not from some contrived   juvenile intrusion    the acting   from big time stars john cusack and kevin spacey   is as good as you d expect   but it s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm    cusack plays a free lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town   country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey s parties    lots of food   beverages and gunplay    yes   an employee of spacey s has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead    it seems like a simple matter of self  defense    the guy threatened spacey   shot at him   missed   then spacey took him out    but being a movie   there s much more to it than that   and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder   a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in    the weird circle of entertainment    this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in    there s the requisite sexy woman   alison   nepotist s daughter   eastwood     the strange piano player   the voodoo woman and the transvestite    miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his her own   as the stealer of every scene she appears in    what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony    chablis   playing herself   is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul   but never seems exploited as the movie s comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie    there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes   which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie   but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating    certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey s lawyer both help immensely   as does having the fly guy as the jury s foreman    it s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey s homosexuality    yes   spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man    before he shot him   of course    midnight in the garden of good and evil isn t a classic   but it is one of the better celebrity directed   true story best seller adaptations out there    likewise   no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations   but the performances are all great    in fact   i d almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category    serving america for more than 1 25th of a century    
1702	1	let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film   i really wasn t looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films    i m not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years    i m happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film    by that point   it was evident that mr   bond was back with a vengeance    all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren t exactly a pleasant experience    it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts    it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in    i guess they can be excused though   taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain    anyway   after somebody remembered what the light switch was for   i settled in for bond    i think the most noticeable aspect of this   the 19th film in the series   is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films    there were probably more one liners in this movie than in the last several combined    and bond s last one liner in the film is about the best of the series    the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series    everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007    for the most part   the action sequences worked very well    although   there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top   even for a bond film    i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted    while he did a good job for the most part   there were points in the movie   specifically during action sequences   that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film    most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie    he almost seemed like he didn t know what he was doing    but they were brief scenes and really shouldn t take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing    if you have ever seen a bond film   you won t be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit    the world is not enough is no exception    this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world    007 matches wits with the terrorist renard   robert carlyle     a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain    why this point is included is beyond me    they took great pains to explain his condition   but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought    anyway   renard   like the typical terrorist that he is   is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid east oil pipeline    i guess world domination just isn t as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore    bond is brought in to protect the pipeline s owner   elektra king   sophie marceau     who is the daughter of one of renard s recent victims    along the way   bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist   dr   christmas jones   denise richards     and his old rival valentin zukovsky   robert carlyle      like all bond films   you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot   since it is ridiculous beyond words    my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films    there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing    the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau s character    it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly    although not included in the film    later   it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something    but because it is a bond film   the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly    after all   it isn t shakespeare    how about the cast    brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007    i grew up with the roger moore version of bond   so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character    judi dench   as m   had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role    she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner    robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye   so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie    coltrane gets more screen time   which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes    then there are the bond girls    sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today    there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim    those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face    marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest    then we have denise richards    there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks    and after you see the outfits she wears   you won t have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer s eyes    i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist    admittedly   there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue   but other than that she stacks up   no pun intended   to her bond girl predecessors nicely    i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle s character    while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had   his character just never worked for me    the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character   but it just never quite got off the ground    i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character   but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character    this might have worked well in another movie   but i don t go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations    last   but not least   we have desmond llewelyn as q   this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond s gadget guy   and he is as good as ever    although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films   he is still a treat to watch    rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role    he says future appearances are up to a higher power    the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement   a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese    while we don t see much of him in this film   i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn s legacy   whenever it is passed on   will be in very capable hands    so how does it stack up    despite some problems   the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie    and   all things considered   what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies    this is easily the best of the brosnan films    it may even be the best of the entire series   certainly in the top 3    one thing is for sure   even after 19 movies   there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series    here s looking forward to bond number 20    
24	0	   knock off   is exactly that   a cheap knock off of an action movie    it s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year    i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998   but alas   it has already been found    jean claude van damme stars as   i think   a designer jeans executive who discovers his half brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods    rob schneider plays van damme s partner   and rochon plays        actually   i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be    she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there    many things are not explained in this film   but i do know that for some bizarre reason   van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick    where chan comes off as endearing in his   normal guy   character seen in many of his films   van damme just comes off as a wimp    we re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions    to be more clear   i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie   and even then   it was not made too clear    the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong    tsui hark   who directed van damme s last movie   the bad   but not nearly as bad as this     double team     never lets the camera rest for a second   and that s no exaggeration    we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme s foot entering a shoe    fabulous    seriously   though   i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions   as long as they don t get carried away    for example   look at sam raimi       army of darkness     one of his best movies   features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen   but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story    that s a concept that tsui can t seem to grasp    the special effects and outrageous camera angles   rule     knock off   to the point where the audience doesn t have a clue as to what s happening any more    another problem with the film is that it looks cheap    the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night    and for some inexplicable reason   everyone s voice seems to have been dubbed    even the stars    and even the special effects   seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about   are inconsistent    for example   there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window    the car slams into the ground   and the left wheel is completely destroyed    seconds later   the car drives off at full speed    hey   i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie   but a line must be drawn somewhere    finally   the acting    nobody gives a good performance in this film    van damme   an actor i usually like   is way off the mark playing   everyman      and schneider   here to provide comic relief i assume   is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene    even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over the top performance as        once again   i have no idea who he was supposed to be    in case i haven t yet made it clear enough     knock off   is the worst movie of van damme s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade    and it s not even one of those movies that s so bad it s funny    it s too inept to be funny    there are no redeeming factors in   knock off   and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased    
606	0	an affluent horse breeder s past comes up to haunt him   an ages old cover up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices    that s pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow    that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source    the acting in particular i found very good   the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie    a few things about the story didn t sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone   yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better    on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot    the character s aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing    as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener    all these people acted their parts admirably   as for the part that sharon stone played   she played it well but the part was not utilized enough    the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie   this is one of those occasions    matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject   i myself wouldn t be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it      there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this    the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing   the subject matter in my opinion wasn t interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it    i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don t like it    all in all i found this movie boring and very slow   the acting was good but the story just didn t evolve enough and wasn t captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch    although there is much going for the movie i didn t find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them    i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie

shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi   and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts    comments     star trek   the next generation   was a hugely successful sequel tv series to   star trek     a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s    even though it still enjoyed high ratings     star trek   the next generation   ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original   star trek    s cast in paramount s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise    star trek   insurrection is the ninth   star trek   movie and the third to focus on the   star trek   the next generation   crew    star trek   insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans   such as myself   would rate somewhere between   okay   and   good      after star trek v   the final frontier   a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant   star trek   voyager   tv series     star trek   fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise    i don t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies    most people reading this probably haven t followed   star trek   anyway   so a comparison would seem tedious at best    let me   thus   make my comparisons briefly so that it s out of my system   star trek   insurrection is not as good as the previous installment   star trek   first contact   star trek   insurrection s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv   the voyage home   star trek ii   the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie    okay   let s move to the movie itself    star trek   insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise   humanity s exploration and colonization of space   with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners    this combination works well more often than it fails   but when it does fail   the humor really seems cheesy    much of this film appeals to trek fans  nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise s crew    audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times    star trek   insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba ku homeworld    forget the actors and special effects   the beautiful setting of this movie   with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys   steals the show    this tranquility   however   is broken by data   an android   who reveals to the ba ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies   the son a    it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth   sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young   healthy state    the enterprise crew   led by captain picard   investigates data s actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba ku and plunder the planet s youth restoring properties    sound pretty heavy    it is   though this plot   anything but unique and groundbreaking   is undermined by the film s constant barrage of humor    when going after data   for instance   picard sings an opera piece with him   this is supposed to be cute and humorous      in a much more funny sequence   work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba ku homeworld   a pimple which his crewmates   try as they might   cannot avoid looking at    the acting in star trek   insurrection is   for the most part   pretty good    since they ve been playing these characters for years   those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough    the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean luc picard and delivers a moral speech   picard s trademark   with his usual aplomb    brent spiner   another fine actor   plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film   though the old android wishing to be human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series      the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good    despite many other critics  negative opinions   f   murray abraham   the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus   plays the major villain ru afro well enough    ru afro reminds me   somewhat   of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune    like the baron   ru afro continuously has his skin looked after   it is stretched and stapled by servants    in one particularly memorable scene   ru afro becomes very agitated   and his facial skin splits open and bleeds    ru afro is no khan from star trek ii  the best trek villain ever  but he is much better than the forgettable dr   soran from star trek   generations       okay   i promise   no more comparisons      donna murphy must also be noted as a ba ku woman   anij   who picard falls in love with    murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body   she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance    this is the type of woman whom picard   for those who know the character well   would be enchanted with    in fact   the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here    a particular plot point involving anij s ability to slow time down   an ability which she shares with picard   becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie    for as good as the actors and setting were   star trek   insurrection s special effects were surprisingly disappointing    they proved adequate   sometimes barely   for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film   but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars   the phantom menace   a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection      the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships   in particular   seemed trite and unsuspenseful   and the final confrontation between picard and ru afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite    the new enterprise itself   only seen in this film and its predecessor   remains largely unexplored   though its exterior doesn t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain    despite star trek   insurrection s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects   i enjoyed the film    it maintains roddenberry s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors   particularly star trek   first contact   though   don t get me wrong   the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully      i d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon   especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general    rated pg   i can t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience   young or old

1028	1	for those of us who weren t yet born when the 1960 s rock  n  rolled around   monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies    from otis redding to jimi hendrix   janis joplin to the mamas and the papas   and jefferson airplane to the who   this documentary is jam packed with contagious energy    but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending   which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves    shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock   the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time    sure   some have painted their faces and smoke joints   but d   a    pennebaker   the war room   moon over broadway   surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience    no matter who is watching   it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul    the excitement starts before the music even begins    a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer   she replies that she feels lucky to do so    there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips   leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers   tries to get in touch with dionne warwick    and when one band is tuning up   a member remarks     finally   a decent sound system      you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn t about vanity   it s about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it   a two way street    this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience    it s impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain    and while the lyrics to   wild thing   may not be all that complicated   watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love    even if you don t recognize every band you see on stage   you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats    the only drawback to the film is the ending   which unfortunately i must reveal    all the other bands   big names then and still today   got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time    in contrast   the last band on camera   a wholly forgettable one   gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time    for a film that s only 78 minutes long   that s too large of a chunk   especially when previous acts are much more stimulating    all in all   monterey pop is a precious   rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us    the variety of music   as well as the beautifully shot performances   are easy to become immersed in    if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular   this is quickly dispelled    it s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn t get made much anymore    instead we re stuck with   nsync   the backstreet boys   and jennifer lopez   all of whom should have stuck with modeling

1720	1	usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug   but not the big lebowski    the new offering from the creators of 1996 s critical hit fargo   is to say the least   wildly entertaining    originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother s movies   and the big lebowski is insanely original    it begins oddly enough when jeff   the dude   lebowski   jeff bridges   is mistaken for a millionaire   jeff   the big   lebowski   david huddleston     who s wife   bunny   tara reid   owes money all over town    two goons   out to collect on bunny s debt break into dude s house    they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug    the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team   steve buscemi   john goodman   respectively      he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug    he does this   and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper    this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments    the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly    also several great supporting roles   john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus    the coen s script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining    i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo   but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998    if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one   if not they give this one a try its a little different    
798	0	wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you    you can see its plot developing from a mile away   you  are lured into its benign story of a single 29 year old girl looking for a soul mate in boston   as that city is depicted as a mini wonderland for singles    this is a star oriented film   and the star who carries the film is erin   hope davis      that this is a dating film   about singles who for reasons of fate or luck   or whatnot   have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers   is nothing new   this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films    the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film   the  main quirk in the plot here   is that hope s pushy mother   hollan   visits her in boston   sees her daughter s live in relationship with a radical protester   hoffman   breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop out daughter   who works as a nurse    this is done without her knowledge    it is cornball sitcom stuff   but   at least   it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director    it is easy to like erin   she is bright   caring   and attractively blonde    it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with   the financially strapped   ruggedly handsome   intelligent 35 year old alan   alan     who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist    of course   he comes across as being so good   though   he does kill some fish in the aquarium     that it is hard to believe he s for real   or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for    the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as   the subway   at a restaurant   or on the phone    alan s brother answers erin s ad with a few of his pals   as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way   making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her   that the others witness   will win the bet    this sub plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told    that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are   each one more annoying than the other   culminating in the most obnoxious one of all   that brazilian lover   jose     who is about as charming as a snake oil salesman   who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil   was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story    anyway   as expected   all s well that ends well   for this watchable piece of fluff   that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story line    the dialogue was actually not bad   those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation    and   oh   by the way   wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro   it is where greyhound racing takes place    
155	0	tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers   all searching for deeper meaning    however   they won t find much meaning in the real blonde   and not enough real humor   either    joe   matthew modine   is a struggling actor   or he claims to be one   even though he has no credits under his belt    his girlfriend   mary   catherine keener   has no pretensions about her career   she s a makeup artist   working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair   marlo thomas   and supermodel of the month   sahara   bridgette wilson      sahara   who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid   has an on again   off again relationship with joe s best friend   bob   maxwell caulfield      however   bob has gotten his biggest break yet   a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly   daryl hannah     who may be that illusive woman he s always pursued   a real blonde    there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde   but not enough    the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background   such as sahara s perfume ads     depression   it s not just a state of mind      but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel    and   unfortunately   the film s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic    take for example the film s framing device of an old lady and her dog    the story serves absolutely no purpose   makes little sense   and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie    matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film   but they re stuck in the most boring plotlines    modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley   who appears as another struggling actor    keener s character has a stronger edge   but the insult self defense class   taught by denis leary   no less   she is stuck in makes little sense    the movie s running time is under two hours   but it seems like it is well over it    there s just not enough humor to speed things along   and not enough meaning to propel any drama    
1764	1	what is freedom    how does one determine who is free    in 1839   those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now    yet   the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations    that is   in essence   what steven spielberg s gripping drama   amistad   is about    through its various dramas   spielberg presents a case about a group of africans   who   after being seized from their home   were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard   la amistad      on their way there   the slaves   led by cinque   djimon hounsou     rebelled   killing off part of the crew    however   the ship was still directed towards the united states   where the africans were brought to trial under murder    in the court   various factions claim ownership of the slaves   and therefore try to seize them away    the united states government   led by president martin van buren   nigel hawthorne     and secretary of state secretary forsyth   david paymer     try to ship the africans to spain   where an 11 year old isabella ii   anna paquin   wants them back    the two spaniards who own   la amistad   want the slaves for themselves    the american ship that found the slaves also wants them    in the midst of this are two abolitionists   stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman     who want the slaves to be free    they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey   who tries to free them    through various legal proceedings   the case appears before the supreme court   where it is argued by ex president john quincy adams   anthony hopkins      the film itself is a visual wonder    spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark   somber mood when appropriate   and a visual setting when appropriate as well    at times   the film is very slow   and very methodical    however   spielberg is not at his finest here   because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag    the film is   in essence   a courtroom drama   one whose events are oversimplified    the characterization is also weak   displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin   mcconaughey     and especially morgan freeman s abolitionist    but spielberg s finest work in the film   the opening scene   a scene of cinque s family   and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america   is altogether stunning    it is this emotional force that carries the film    mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans   hopkins is sensational as the old adams   freeman is outstanding when used   spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents     and the rest of the cast is stellar    the movie   however   belongs to hounsou    his emotional intensity is brilliant    spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou   and the film s extraordinary power is simply captivating    the film is flawed   for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard    but that doesn t matter    the story is a gripping one   and one of extreme importance    kudos to spielberg for finding it   finding the right men for the job   and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque    a good job all around

1588	1	 note   after claiming otherwise   my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh s hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap    as it happens   it didn t take long      is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli    known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968 s romeo and juliet   required viewing for many high schoolers   and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare     he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera   where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria    last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre   one of the twin peaks   with wuthering heights   of romantic literature    it might seem peculiar   then   that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen    at first blush   hamlet is far removed from romance    the hero   though a prince   is depressed   conflicted and confused    the ostensible love interest gets little screen time   and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery    the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus    it is zeffirelli s genius   however   that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace    in this italian master s hands   romance is everywhere    in a son s worship of his father   in the bonds of deepest friendship   in the private thoughts of young lovers   even in the mystery of castles by the sea    after all   the story hinges on a ghost   and what could be more romantic than that    what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all   namely   hiring then reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead    who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a   lethal weapon     in the series of the same name   would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language    franco zeffirelli   that s who    and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money    what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful   not to mention comprehensible    his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed    his movements and gestures   excepting his sometimes too active eyes   are totally in keeping with the character    this is a hamlet whose pain we feel   whose struggle we empathize with   and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film s end    glenn close   the other big name in the production   also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet s mother   gertrude    though i must confess i m still trying to understand the character as written       zeffirelli s incestuous interpretation of hamlet s relationship with his mother doesn t help      alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy    by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably    of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone    both support the realistic mood marvelously   as do the sets and costumes     without any overstated effects that declare   this is important   this is shakespeare      i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all   the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due    perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare   definitive      and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen    but if you ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard   this hamlet is an excellent place to start    
1543	1	capsule   this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film   set in the present    robert deniro stars as a risk adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend   played by marlon brando      edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime    the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense        2    4 to  4    i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before    this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens    there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment    there is no rock score    there are no ballet  like martial arts    this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un flashy script    nick   played by robert deniro   is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks    if a job is not a safe bet   pun intended     he backs out    sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe    when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game    he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club   and decides to manage it full time    he proposes to his girl friend diane   angela bassett      she has one condition    he must stay retired from crime    but before the deal can be cemented   max   a montreal kingpin and personal friend   has one last supposedly easy job for nick    nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal    more and more details seem to complicate the job    nick s partner in the crime is to be a smart   but uncontrollable young crook   jack   edward norton      jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat   even at his associates  homes    the young crook is a know it all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way    together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house    the script by kario salem   lem dobbs   and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old   mission impossible   television series    we see pieces of the heist being put together   last minute changes   and things that go wrong   much like a good episode of   mission impossible      this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise   mission impossible   films    the complications are   however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable    the telling is cold and noirish   which is just what it is supposed to be    director frank oz   the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film    the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene stealing acting    edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low key by today s standards    he plays what is nearly a double role    jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house    one nice        character i have not mentioned is stephen   jamie harrold      stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother s basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions    he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon    the film itself remains low key up until the time of the climactic heist    then the pace really picks up    before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes    though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown    on the subject of music   the score of the score is by howard shore    it adds tension to the suspense scenes   but never seems to have much of a melody    angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break    she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does    speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s    it does the job    i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a  2 on the  4 to  4 scale    
1819	1	showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven   director   and joe eszterhas   writer    their last effort   basic instinct   played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock   with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry spiced tabasco sauce   a dish not to everyone s taste   but certainly a well crafted movie    possibly that movie s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage   prior to the movie   during the movie   and after the movie        and that   after bringing all the plotlines together neatly   it left the viewer with full knowledge of what   would   happen in the characters  future   so there was no need to film it    there was actually about four hours  worth of screen story there   but eszterhas found ways to get it all on screen in two   by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on   and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails    the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls    we have attractive   sympathetic   but still highly repellent characters   we have shows for the eyes and the ears   plotlines that play on several levels   we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable   and we have a story of an innocent   who may not be so innocent   who s trying to play straight   trying to improve her station in life   who slips into behaving the way those around her do        but recovers with a flourish   and quits a winner    in this sense   the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven   who s not known for treating his characters well   but nomi   the part played by elizabeth berkley   definitely opts out of the game in a positive way   and we re left feeling good about her future    this is not one of the great movies   but it s far better than we d been led to expect by all the negative pre release publicity    verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971   and in the last quarter century has pushed farther and farther   experimenting with the socially acceptable limits to movie making    his most recent three movies   robocop   total recall   and basic instinct   have been a progression of back door access to american culture   moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives   and now he s exploring the sleeze    this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie       verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating   although his original version is available on video      many reviewers have taken the politically correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing   but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies   it s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common   and why such an environment should exist    it s about the scum who use other people as power trip toys   and the need to escape their power    it s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don t pertain   and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment    an nc 17 movie which isn t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty   power   or value    the one scene in the movie that   could   have been a good sex scene   berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool   is not exciting   because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator    if anything   it s a rape scene with a victim who s been duped into cooperation    you don t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors   you don t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed   and you don t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls        and in an awful lot of vegas shows   an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing    this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry   in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity    showgirls de glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness    nomi is played   in a very good performance   by elizabeth berkley   who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who s at the end of her rope   desperate to live a life better than the one she s known    she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability   and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker   trying to be something better than she seems destined to be    when nomi realizes she s gone too far for too little   she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be    gina rivera plays molly   a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi   providing her with what may be the one solid   positive relationship in nomi s entire life    molly is the one who makes the difference   and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she ll be using for the rest of her life   and nomi s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi s decision    gina gershon plays cristal   an aging   but still very attractive starring dancer   a reflexively competitive manipulator who s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her    gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch   a fading talent made bitter by self awareness    her character is very well drawn and performed   in a major scene in a hospital room   she acknowledges what she is   and   in essence   passes the torch to nomi    the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie   and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path    it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe   molly is an honest   hard working person who means well   and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality    cristal is a talented dancer who s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co operating part of the system   exchanging self respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas    nomi believes she can make it without selling herself   succumbs to a degree   and then realizes she can make it without selling herself   and doesn t need las vegas or its brand of   stardom      the male parts in this movie are simply props   they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist    kyle maclachlan   whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden   gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs   camouflaged as a nice guy    glenn plummer plays a dancer who s working as a bellboy   and provides a bit of alternate perspective    plummer s character is the only one in the movie who s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art   but even he s succumbed to the cult of manipulation    plummer s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie    some of jost vacano s cinematography is fantastic   and one particular delineation of nomi s character alteration   a no dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting   is utterly terrifying    this movie is rated nc 17 due to language   sexual situations   full frontal nudity   violence   and probably the costuming as well    i don t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it   and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie making    but don t go see it if you re not in a tough mood   the only person it s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i   c   u    on life support   and there is probably not one character in this movie you d enjoy meeting in person    
151	0	when i originally saw the trailer for   analyze this   a few months ago   i must admit   i thought it looked kind of lame    and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago   i thought it looked outright bad    but then when   analyze this   finally opened a few days ago   an odd thing happened    it got great reviews    critics were proclaiming it   hilarious   and a   dead on parody of mob movies      well   with praise like that   i figured   it must be good and so i headed off to the theater    you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts    well   turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for       analyze this   is slow   unfunny   and badly acted    don t get me wrong   i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century   but he is just out of his league here    i think the problem is he didn t quite know how to approach this material    he plays his character   mob boss paull vitti   somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama    if he had played the character straight   along the lines of leslie nielson in the   naked gun   series   he probably would have been a lot more successful    as it is   though   he plays the character completely serious at some moments   and for laughs at others    this doesn t work    it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold   you always know it s him    and the movie is badly paced   too    it never takes off    it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum    i think the blame for this should be placed on the script    it s obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie   mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist   but once this is established   the movie doesn t really go anywhere    the formula of the film seems to be this   billy crystal says no to deniro   deniro forces him   and much wackiness ensues    this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie    i ve said it before and i ll say it again   the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it s funny    if   analyze this   had been funny   the pacing and bad acting wouldn t have bothered me    i would have been too busy laughing to notice    but as it is   i only chuckled a few times    the only really funny scene is a dead on parody of   the godfather      sadly   though   i don t think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody   because i was the only one laughing    but my sense of humour   i have come to realize   is vastly different from the general population    i loathed   there s something about mary     yet loved   baseketball      now   if you want a movie that   i   think is funny   go out and see   office space      it s full of genuine laughs and won t leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes   as   analyze this   did    
95	0	numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci fi   suspense thrillers    soldier is a multi   crossbreed between the likes of terminator   aliens and offspring    the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel   not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground    besides this   the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age    the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured   slow and sluggish   and could have done with better choreography    russell who is usually a good actor in b grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character   sergeant todd   who seems more like a sergeant toad    besides having almost no dialogue   his character appears stunted   zombie like which is in line with his screen persona   but scores little points of empathy with the audience    this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson   whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth    although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former   it is still a long way from anything considered desirable

1359	1	   if there s a beast in men   it meets its match in women   too      starring sarah patterson   angela lansbury   tusse silberg   david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter   from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus  in recent years   there has been a trend in the field of fantasy   writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world   investing it with new life and energy    in modern times   fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased   they have become trite adventures involving leering witches   friendly dwarves   and cuddly talking animals    but in their original forms   fairy tales have a dark   wicked edge    crows tear out the eyes of cinderella s sisters   a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version    hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven    writers have become fascinated by the bloodier   morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales   and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots    before this trend was in vogue   angela carter  whose stories always have a dark   wicked   subversive edge  had been reinventing fairy tales for years    in the company of wolves   she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood   enlivening it with werewolves   rolls royces   and a visit from satan    the story is structured as a dream   occurring in the mind of rosaleen   sarah patterson     an adolescent girl about whose  real  life we learn very little    within the dream   there are a number of inset stories   most told by dream rosaleen s grandmother   angela lansbury     and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing   suggestive ways    the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister   contemporary fairy tale    i say   surprisingly   because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong    and there are ways in which it does    the performances are mediocre   except for lansbury s  she finds the right note for the prim   apple cheeked granny   the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales    the soundtrack   synth heavy   reminded me of bad 80s horror movies   as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes    probably state of the art at the time   they are now laughable    but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film   he transcends the poor acting music effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic   of otherness    one of the problems in adapting full blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader   rather than being subjected to the  realism  of the screen    part of me would love to see an adaptation of  the lord of the rings     but   on the other hand   i know that any filmmaker s recreation of ents   hobbits   and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind    this makes jordan s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me   he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery    the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur reality    the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant    the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly    the peasant village is rustic and cozy   the woods old and hoary    this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart   subtle   literate script   a script which is as good as you d expect from jordan   himself an accomplished fiction writer   and carter    for carter   the cauldron of story is a witches  brew   bubbling over with primal ingredients   mist shrouded forests   ancient graveyards   virginal girls and wise women   wolves with glowing eyes    she adeptly blends them all together    there is a symbolic richness to the film   everything is permeated with a sense of significance    the point of it all   i think   is to represent a girl s rites of passage on an unconscious   primordial level    a night journey through the forest   from the village to the grandmother s home   is the crux of the company of wolves       don t stray from the path     rosaleen is told   again and again   and the path is both literal and figurative   the path through the forest and the path of life    staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen s elders    carter and jordan   never conventional   explore what goes on when you leave the path    those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate    this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves   but the werewolves connote many things   death   sex   knowledge    if straying from the path leads to death   then it s not a good idea  but if that s what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge   and therefore power     then maybe it s worth the risk    when you leave the path   the world becomes a dangerous   ambiguous place   but it s full of potential    and it s certainly more interesting than the disney version    
1842	1	the question isn t why has grease been reissued    the answer to that one is easy   to celebrate the movie s 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount s coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity    no   the question that ought to be asked is   should grease be reissued    the answer is not an easy one    grease is a fun movie   an entertaining fantasy of the  50s   embodying all the cliches of that era    the music is lively and the dance numbers   choreographed by patricia birch   are energetic and high spirited    travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon   cool   but non threatening    but grease didn t break any new cinematic ground    it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider    what grease is   or has become   is the highest grossing musical in film history    ok   let s not be a spoilsport    grease is a fun and entertaining movie   even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta   olivia newton john   taxi s jeff conaway and the multi talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers    it s nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was   and it s sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career    he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly    cinematically   the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur    between grease and 1996 s evita     you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand    two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre   the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated   no   make that cynical and jaded    today   if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight   he or she would probably be hooted off the screen    today s audiences lack the innocence   that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed    secondly   a lack of talent    performers with the charisma   the style   the larger than life panache of fred astaire   gene kelly   ginger rogers and judy garland are gone    most singers and dancers remain on the stage   and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts    a good example is gregory hines   one of the greatest dancers in the world    he danced a bit in the cotton club   tap and white nights   but those were essentially dramatic vehicles    so   perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose    if audiences show enough interest   meaning if the re release earns the studio enough revenue   it may spark a revival in movie musicals    perhaps not original musicals such as singin  in the rain   an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers   but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years    at one time or another   according to the industry rumor mill   hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber s cats   a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago   the latter reportedly to star madonna    so   let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals    let grease be the word that sparks this revival    
809	0	and i thought   stigmata   would be the worst religiously oriented thriller released this year    turns out i was wrong   because while   stigmata   was merely boring and self important     end of days   is completely inept on all fronts    it s a silly   incomprehensible   endlessly stupid mess    for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best   it s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up    for the first time in recent memory   an arnold action movie   and   batman   robin   doesn t count   is no fun at all       end of days   is a major stinker    the movie opens in vatican city   1979    some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy   which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation    if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31   1999   the world will be destroyed    the pope orders protection of this girl   though some priests believe she ought to be killed    in new york   that very night   a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy    twenty years later   we meet jericho cane   schwarzenegger     a suicidal ex cop with a drinking problem    now working as a security guard for hire   he is protecting a local businessman   gabriel byrne     who is actually possessed by the devil    an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after   christine york   robin tunney      recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine   including ownership of the same music box   apparently     jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her    there are so many problems with this film it s hard to know where to begin   but how about starting with the concept    casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with    schwarzenegger is a persona   not an actor   so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea    arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions    in other words   trying to give him dimension was a mistake    harrison ford   mel gibson   or even bruce willis could have played this role   they ve all played noble and flawed heroes     but not schwarzenegger    there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho s character   one has him contemplating suicide   another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter   and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine s location by offering him his old life back    none of these scenes really work   because arnie isn t up to the task    the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong   confident character   like the terminator   for example     the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before    this one isn t at all believable the way arnold plays him    the supporting cast tries their hardest   and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all    as the prince of darkness   he s suave and confident    he acts like one would expect the devil to act    the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense   more on that later   and that undermines him as a powerful villain    byrne out performs arnold in every scene they have together   including the aforementioned temptation bit     but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable   root for the devil    byrne s speech about the bible being   overrated   actually starts to make sense   mainly because arnold s attempts at refuting it   mostly of the    tis not      variety   are feeble at best    the only problem is   arnold has to win   so in the end   nobody really cares    kevin pollack plays jericho s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides   but like most bad action movie sidekicks   he disappears after about an hour    robin tunney isn t given much to do except look scared    in fact   all of the supporting players are good actors   but none   save for byrne   is given anything interesting to do    performances aside   it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it    this being an action blockbuster   it s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script   which starts off totally confusing   and when some of it is explained   and not much of it is     it s utterly ridiculous    why is the devil coming on new year s eve   1999    because it s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil   which isn t 666   it turns out    some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down   so the real year is 999   so just add a 1 to the beginning   and you ve got 1999    if you don t buy this explanation   you re not alone    it s convoluted and silly at the same time    the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous   she s christine   see   and she lives in new york   see               and if that weren t bad enough   there s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn t explained at all    why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street   but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex cop   he s powerless    is he impervious to only one kind of bullet    how come he can t control jericho or christine    and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies    a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this   but it s never actually explained    usually   this sort of thing wouldn t matter in a schwarzenegger flick   i mean   don t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies     but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting    there are several predictable horror film clich   s present in   end of days     complete with the old   black cat hiding in a cabinet   bit   not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there    it gets so formulaic that it s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a   boo   will come    their predictions will rarely be wrong    the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless   partially because we don t care about these characters   due to the script s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup     and also because they   too   don t make any sense    there s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady    it s good for a few chuckles   but not much else    supposedly we re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan   but the script never sets that up   so the scene is merely silly    none of this is terribly exciting   because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it s often hard to tell why it s happening in the first place   not to mention that they re edited in full on incomprehensible mtv quick cut style    most of them had me scratching my head   rather than saying     wow   cool         end of days   is not only silly and confusing   but it s also distinctly unpleasant to watch    the devil apparently doesn t operate in the more subtle   i ll convince people to kill each other fashion outlined in the bible   but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight    this doesn t only make him an awfully predictable sort   but it also means that not a single scene in   end of days   goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence   or the odd kinky sexual encounter   yet another bit that had me scratching my head      if violence is supposed to be shocking   it s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb    scenes aren t connected through any reasonable means   so a lot of the time   stuff gets blown up   or people get killed   and i had no idea why    reasons    to hell with reasons    let s just blow stuff up    isn t it cool    nope   not by a long shot    this film is thoroughly unwatchable    it s dull   interminable   and unrelenting in its stupidity    perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career   because it s not happening with hack peter hyams here       end of days   might have had camp value   if only it didn t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody s going to buy    if the movie is going to be serious   the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script    if it s going to be campy   arnold shouldn t be taking himself so damn seriously   i didn t actually see him put up on a cross   did i       and his character shouldn t be such a sad sack    as it stands     end of days   is just a bad movie   and an awfully gloomy one at that

1577	1	underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today    1998 s  hope floats  was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year    we always get films that make big money at the box office but critics and audiences pan on them    this year  double jeopardy  is one of those films    critics are calling it predictable and worthless   audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment    but as i viewed  double jeopardy  i found that it was a great movie   it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart   along with heart pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie    the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons   a woman with a seemingly normal life   a great loving husband   a beautiful son and a great friend    her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted    after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat   her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck    of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her    however she isn t immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money    she pleads not guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years    while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad   which makes libby s heart stop right there    she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn t dead   one of her cell mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again    which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it    after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones    he is a man who has had his share of bad things    while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband   leading up to some jaw dropping twists that are both predictable and not    whatever happens the film was excellent to me    i found the writing well written as well as the acting was great    ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie    even if you know what is going to happen in the end   you don t know how    this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen   except you don t know how they are going to make it happen    it could be one way or another   it could be this way or that way    the movie is highly stylized and extremely well made    it gets most of it s power from the two leads   ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances    the characters are well realized and believable and we feel libby s pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years    even though a lot of critics didn t like the film   i loved it    the director took his time making the movie   and put a lot of shadowing in the movie    i found it not to be boring at all and it s only flaw comes from some predictability    it moved at a fast pace   has suspense   humor   heart and great acting    it earns it s right to be a great movie and to me that s what it was

rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in   lumumba      patrice lumumba s   eriq ebouaney   story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary     lumumba   death of a prophet     virtually guaranteeing that his new   fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject    peck   with co writer pascal bonitzer   begins at the end of the story of the young political leader    we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men    images of hatchets   saws and fast emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image    jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian owned congo    a third class postal worker   lumumba   speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes   proclaiming himself not tribal   not regional   but a national leader    his small   mobile party   the congolese national movement   mnc   is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer   and get his face known   in the bustling capital   stanleyville    at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world   lumumba is in the right place at the right time and   through political savvy and chess like manipulation   achieves a position of leadership of the mnc    as the date for independence approaches   he tactically positions himself to be the new nation s first prime minister and defense minister   supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu   maka kotto      the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country s vast natural resources of copper   diamonds   gold and more    lumumba won t seek the help of the us   knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government    his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination    the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies   the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves   belgian troops violently intervene   the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe   pascal nzonzi   and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad    this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries    peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba   his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50 s and 60 s       during the time the story takes place   many new nations   including nigeria and somalia   were born   with varying degrees of success and failure   usually dependent upon which country colonized them    some colonial masters were better than others      the effort involved in   lumumba   is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades   if at all    production values are first rate on what must be a small   by us standards   budget    the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique    the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba s life    the political side of things is evenly told in a linear   straightforward manner that teaches   not preaches    it concentrates on the good deeds of the man   if a bit as a stalwart saint   but doesn t embellish on a larger than life persona    the family side of patrice s life is handled in several   perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children   embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child    i know the intent is to flesh the man out   but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba    the story   as such   has a lopsided feel about it    high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character    the actor gives a convincing   charismatic performance as the multifaceted   politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions    in true docudrama tradition   the supporting cast does not outshine the star   complementing his good efforts   instead       lumumba   is a solid   interesting   educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos   both    it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b

201	0	come on hollywood   surprise me    stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue   sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset    the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls    personal   because his niece is one of the victims    it s a slobbering psychopath   of course   but this time there s a twist    freeman notes that each of the young women who ve disappeared are all strong willed   assertive   and more successful in their careers than the average girl    we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova   whose aim is to   dominate   these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem    anyway   one of the women manages to escape   ashly judd   and teams up with freeman to       well    you know the rest    a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs   with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants   may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story    perhaps   but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue    so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further   okay    and as for comparisons to seven       oh  please    kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass    maybe the novel was a stinker to start with   but whatever the case   it s the writing that s clearly at fault here    one   these characters have very little to say that s engaging or interesting    two   the script has no sense of humour    three   while the notion of a psycho s victims being smart   successful women is an interesting twist   the execution isn t even half as good as the idea    thus   ashly judd comes across all out of focus   instead of being the heart of the story    we can t feel her rage    some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she s the no bullshit 90 s type   but these conversations barely register    and as for freeman   kiss the girls is his second dog in a year   first chain reaction   now this    for an actor of his calibre   this is most worrying    young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction esque things to do in denver when your dead    but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this    not much   and you can hardly blame him    there s a few well staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls   dives and jumps   and the effect is startling    but the script is beyond rescue    what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe   safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up    complacency rules   it s been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters   real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue    the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie   positive proof that the best things in life aren t free

1898	1	bill condon s   gods and monsters   is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale   ian mckellan     who made the horror classics   frankenstein   and   bride of frankenstein      since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film   there is no way to know how accurate the film is   but i suspect that much of it only came from whale s inner fantasies and hallucinations    whale   who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures   decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him    as the film tells it   during the end of his life   whale   at his large home in l   a     became infatuated with the tall   handsome   and much younger man   clayton boone   brendan fraser     who was working as the gardener at his home    james whale   we learn quickly was   what many people refer to him as in the film     a dirty old man      in one of the opening scenes   a young film enthusiast visits whale s home to interview him and whale agrees   on one condition   for every question he answers   the young man must take off an article of clothing    because of this episode   we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting   later making the excuse that his bright   white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off    clayon agrees   and doesn t really think much of this   much to the warnings of his friends   becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past    certainly   the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall   since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man   even though boone is not gay   and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life   as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis       gods and monsters   is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast   due to his sexual preference   and never got the recognition he would have liked   since he longed to be referred to as a   motion picture director     rather than a   horror director      and in one heartbreaking scene   he attends a party with boone being his guest   held by director george cuckor   and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore    it is evident that whale s first love in his life was making movies   and when his career ultimately fell apart   so did his passion in life    as played brilliantly by ian mckellen   james whale comes off as a sad   but dignified man   and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others   just as long as he knew he was being true to himself    he never hid the fact that he was gay   however   even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession   and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person    through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone   boone   of course   only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to   while it means so much more to whale   who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life    although boone is only in a dead end job as a gardener of people s homes   whale views him as the ideal man   not only one that is good looking   even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings   but one that will actually listen to him    since whale lives with only his loyal   but disapproving maid   touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave     it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world   and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor    although an extremely fine and mature picture   a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness    it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments   but it is a little thin   and the structuring of the   on again off again   friendship at the film s center is fairly predictable    we know early on where these two characters are headed   and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds    in lesser hands   this set up might have felt too calculated   but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this    also   a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar   effectively played by lolita davidovich     but abruptly dropped and never brought up again    if the film was not going to follow up on this side story   then it   perhaps   should have been taken out altogether       gods and monsters   is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture   impressively directed by bill condon   who   i sense   relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone    the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end    walking away from   gods and monsters     it was ian mckellen s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me   and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably    it is a sad testament when a person s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them   based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life   which   ironically enough   is no one else s business in the first place    
1509	1	capsule   side splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end        but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs    most comedies these days have one flaw    they re not funny    they think they re funny   but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly    occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem   ruthless people   for instance   which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end    liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny    this is one of the few movies i ve seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through   instead of a couple of set pieces that inspired a laugh   think of the dismal fatal instinct     the whole movie works like clockwork    jim carrey playes a high powered lawyer   to whom lying is as natural as breathing    there is one thing he takes seriously   though   his son   and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away    but his wife is divorced and seeing another man   and now it looks like they may move away together    the son goes with them   of course    the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey s over the top persona with reality    then the plot springs into action   after being snubbed   not deliberately   by his father at his birthday   the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles   that for just one day   dad can t lie    he gets the wish    what happens next is sidesplitting    everything turns into a confrontation   when cornered by a bum for some change   he shouts     no    i m not giving you any money because i know you ll spend it on booze    all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society      he can t even get into an elevator without earning a black eye    and what s worse   he s now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture    carrey   who i used to find unfunny   has gotten better at his schtick   even if it s a limited one    he uses it to great effect in this movie    there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process   there s a grin breaking out across my face right now   just remembering the scene      he can t even write the lie   his fingers twitch   his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning   and when he tries to talk it s like he s speaking in tongues    equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp   don t ask why     tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom   it fails   with semi predictable results     and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them    this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end    the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end    a shame   too   because the movie insists on having a big   ridiculous climax that involves carrey s character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs   then breaking his leg   etc   a simple reconciliation would do the trick    why is this stupid pent up climax always obligatory    it s not even part of the movie s real agenda    thankfully   liar liar survives it   and so does carrey    maybe they were being merciful   on reflection    if i d laughed any more   i might have needed an iron lung    
322	0	this movie is based off the wildly popular video game series of the same name    before this film   the game had a few spin off cartoons  which were ok    but the idea of doing a movie is insane    it should have been animated   if it should have been done at all    instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast    yet it still fails    the plot is completely different from the game s plot  i m not complaining about that    the story involves the mario bros   having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company    eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis   which happens to be enviromentally un safe    so   due to luigi s   john leguizamo   girlfriend   princess daisy   they go and investigate    they get transported to a blade runner esque world lead by king koopa   dennis hopper      somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega city jumbles in    the plot is fine  better than the movie deserves    the acting is ok    this seems to be more of a visual film    the special effects are good   especially on the robotic yoshi    however the film drags and is no fun    and it leaves itself open to a sequel   which probably won t ever be made    this movie begins sort of promising   but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth    so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper   then watch super mario bros      the movie    you could do worse    but you could definitely do better            street fighter   the movie   1995   starring   raul julia and jean claude van damme  this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2   it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot    it is more like a   movie   than it should be    yes   it s watchable    raul julia does a good job   considering this was his final film    while the game had non stop fighting sequences   this movie is a hodge podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time    does it work    sort of        the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m   bison   raul julia      guile   jean claude van damme   takes his troops to attack bison s main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over    in a short amount of time   the movie introduces several characters well    it catches your attention    but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like   there s chun li        or   look at that fire ball ryu did at vega      it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets   but goes no further    this movie needed more action in the first place    the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting    if you like light hearted action flicks   or if you liked the game   watch this one    it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia s last performance   or if you can t get enough of van damme    other than that   you could find better action flicks        
566	0	my giant begins with a monologue that s more funny than not and a distinctive  princess bride     medieval fairy tale in the    90s feel    i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was   with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy   billy crystal   is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream    and when sammy meets max   his giant   mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan   there is magic in the air   albeit it a bit goofy   i loved every minute of it    the film   of course   plays on the size difference between the two   and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects    i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons    i also liked jere burns    from tv s  something so right    performance as the director of the film in romania    at this point   the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand   particularly during his fast paced first scene    it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate   as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech    however   about the time muresan becomes coherent   the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive    off the high board    suddenly   we are expected to believe sammy is a do whatever it takes slime ball    up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure   but he didn t come off as a desperate jerk    if he had   the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical    but now   in new york   we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son   and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs   midgets wrestling match   which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film    indeed   many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces    this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal   when sammy gets max a role in a big   hollywood movie filming in las vegas    while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself   the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation   rather than because the film demanded it    and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare    at this point i found myself thinking    we re supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film      then i realized he was   and i was watching it    in the final third   the film undergoes another transformation   this time to unbridled sentimentality    note   major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph    max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love   lillianna   who hasn t seen him since he was a normal sized kid    her refusal to see max   unbeknownst to him   leads us to an awkward  ends justify the means  scene as sammy s wife serena   played nicely by kathleen quinlan   poses as lillianna    i found this scene offensive    not only did it rely on deception to induce warm   fuzzy feelings from the audience   it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle   which i thought was quite undeserved    i think max could have handled the truth   gratuitous illness and all    late in the film we learn max   and in fact all giants   have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably    this could be an enlightening revelation   but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy s transformation into a caring   sensitive guy    and hey   a great dad and husband   too     my giant  suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions    a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max s struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy s struggles to get money and become a better person    in this scenario   max s illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator    sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally    instead   we re apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end   but we re not allowed to focus on max    crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances   but in the end    my giant  left me feeling like i d been fed gruel from a giant spoon    
1786	1	it s no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office    a poorly written script can be bested by a superb acting corps   and a well written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs    in directing his latest action comedy   director brett ratner   money talks   takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get out buddy cop movie    in addition   rush hour serves as a first class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude   a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types    the two lead names share equal screen time here   mostly because they spend it together    jackie chan   in his first completely american production   makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts    the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago   knock off   stands no chance against the content of this one    chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise   and there s no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn t believe their eyes the first time    chris tucker   on the opposite side   relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan s performance    he works perfectly with the script   and it s quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines    almost essential to the action genre   the plot is nonexistent    we re quickly introduced to detective james carter   tucker   is a maverick officer for the lapd    cut forward to another scene where the daughter   julia hsu   of the american chinese consul   tzi ma   is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters    the fbi is quick to the rescue   but the consul insists that one of his men   detective inspector lee   chan     be brought on the case to help    the fbi resists   but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective    it s here that carter and lee hook up   and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up    rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up   but it doesn t quite reach the top tier of action comedies like last year s grosse pointe blank    there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to   and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan   this might be a major drawback    also   some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride   and others are there simply to look menacing    however   none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background    almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another   whether it s tucker s toned down routine or chan s tight rein on his action sequences   and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types    a recommendable visit to the theater   indeed    
349	0	if you have ever seen fox tv s special car chase programs   you ll have a good idea about the content of ronin   the new action   thriller   from director john frankenheimer    the film involves a mysterious briefcase   that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on    an irish women   dierdre   played by the truman show s natascha mcelhone     hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase    among the people she hires are sam   robert de niro     vincent   jean reno     and gregor   stellan skarsg   rd from good will hunting      dierdre s groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it    they accomplish this task   but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again    the briefcase stays on the run   as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed    the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie   but failed to understand that just because there are surprises   it doesn t add too the credibility of a senseless script    the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on   after the apparent climax of the film    but to add to the excitement   as i mentioned earlier   there are endless car chase scenes    they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story    don t get me wrong   i love car chases   but they were overdone and too long here    we never do find out what s in the briefcase   but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller    
768	0	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned       quick   robin    the anti shark repellant        adam west in the 1966 batman feature film   casually kicking at a pathetic looking rubber shark attached to his leg  i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness   but in many instances batman and robin nears   and at some point even exceeds this standard    this is a disasterously bad film   easily the worst in the series to date   and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive   it s loud   garish   and obnoxious   with pointless   gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill    batman and robin features the caped crusaders   george clooney debuting as batman   with chris o donnell returing as robin   squaring off against another bevy of chemically induced villains   the nefarious ice cold mr   freeze   arnold schwarzenegger     armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights   and the slinky poison ivy   uma thurman     who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her   not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result   but whatever     and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss    by ivy s side is the giant steroid monster bane   jeep swanson     a grunting hulk of a beast    the villains  goals are noble ones   freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit   in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees     so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife   vendela     dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation   and ivy s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth   albeit by destroying all human life    meanwhile   on the homefront   life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth   michael gough     and the arrival of his niece barbara   alicia silverstone      akiva goldsman s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad   with astonishingly terrible dialogue   lame jokes   and an awful by the number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement    it makes goldsman s screenplay of batman forever   which i thought was dreadful   look positively inspired in comparison    i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i d seen used in   no joke   an episode of gilligan s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production    joel schumacher s direction of batman and robin is horrific   with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance    there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film   even moreso than with his previous batman forever   with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo   just in case   i suppose   if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin     and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy s chosen new abode    another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons    mr   schumacher s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible   to the detriment of the story   there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all out camp and heartfelt drama   with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective    it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film s opening   even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered    is batman and robin supposed to be campy    i think it is   it s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously       one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted   bomb      each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory      is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be    i somehow doubt it   the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn t attempting to be the utter farce which it is    arnold schwarzenegger is top billed in the film as the villainous mr   freeze   and is bland and uninteresting   perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be    mr   schwarzenegger s attempts to be menacing are laughable   and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable   frankly   everything he does onscreen is laughable    by the end of the film   i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen    the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near unintelligble puns and one liners featuring every possible permutation of   cool      in the least inventive way    george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin   being overshadowed by the villains   and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film    his batman is hardly an imposing figure    chris o donnell is unimpressive in a one note performance   while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all    the film s one saving grace    undoubtably uma thurman s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy    her work in batman and robin is certainly over the top   but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film    ms   thurman s comic timing is impeccable   and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully       i m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey s performance in batman forever      her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film   and when she s offscreen the film greatly suffers    i figure that if one has to die   being kissed to death by uma thurman isn t a half bad way to go    while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse pounding excitement   i must admit that i was not bored watching it   although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening   my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one liner   and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat    it s been a long time since i ve laughed so much at a movie       at     of course   is the operative word    
1905	1	robert altman s cookie s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good    it is a sunny   delightful   dreamy comedy   filled with lovely performances   skillful direction and topped off with an understated   clever   extraordinary script    as this is an ensemble piece   it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters   all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs    first we meet willie   charles s   dutton     an honest man with a slight drinking habit    we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie   who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness   despair   and want of her dead husband    we cut to camille   glenn close   who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora   julianne moore      then we briefly get acquainted with emma   liv tyler     an apparent relative of cookie   who is a down but not out teen outcast   still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live    we also fleetingly see emma s lover jason   chris o donnell     an ambitious but far too excitable young cop    we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture   and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion    we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband    she exclaims   here i come      and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself    soon after   her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl   comes upstairs   finds cookie dead and flips out    convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family   she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow   yet sweet   sister that it was a murder    she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well   scattering jewelry all over the floor   breaking a few cabinets   windows and doors   and then throwing the gun out in the back yard    the only reasonable suspect is willie   who immediately gets taken into custody   and put in a jail cell   they all know he didn t do it   so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma      meanwhile   the unperturbed camille continues her none too subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success    so begins cookie s fortune   a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as   a southern spin on fargo     except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers  darker   somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade    robert altman s slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well   in that both films focus   on and off   on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town    indeed   most of the characters in cookie s fortune are loads of fun to observe   and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi  dimensional    glenn close turns in an insubstantial   in terms of her career   but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie   and she is perfectly cast as the prolific   aunt alexandria   character   endlessly obsessed with family dignity    the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s   dutton   mimic   a time to kill    there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours   even days after the film ends    cookie s fortune is such a movie    i loved the light   kindhearted approach altman   whose last project was the dark   intense drama the gingerbread man   took towards the tricky subject matter    i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast    i even liked the trite   in the south everybody is related to everybody   cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close    i m not sure why cookie s fortune had such an all around pleasing effect on me    perhaps it s that good ol  southern charm    
1403	1	 in brief     this film needs no introduction    if you haven t heard of it   then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical   and if you haven t seen it    well   i suspect you re in a small minority    first thing s first   is it all it s hyped up to be    well   yes   and no    it s a good film   and there s a lot to like about it   but it s not without its problems    when i saw the first trailer for   titanic     it was when i went to see   bean   last summer   i think   my intial reaction was    ain t that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful   real life tragedy      i mean   what s happened to hollywood s script writers   have they run entirely out of new ideas    gads   whatever next   i asked myself   how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme    i was not entirely filled with anticipation   but then i wasn t alone in that respect    it s when it came out in the cinema   to rave reviews   well   mostly   and anyone who d been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice    i didn t see the film until several months after its release   by which time my sister had seen it about four times        so i went with a slightly more open mind   but i still didn t think i d enjoy it much    did i   yes and no    mainly yes   i m happy to say    the first hour or so was beautifully done   not so much because of the scripting   i ll talk about that later     but because the re created ship and sets were stunning to look at   as was cameron s directing   and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the   human   aspect of the story   the romance between rose   kate winslet   and jack   leonardo dicaprio     was enchanting    the film is told via flashback   with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day   you knew that   a  course                well   it s an often effective device to use in storytelling    though sometimes it can fall flat    does it work here    in script form it doesn t add all that much to the story    what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart   whose stunning performance is the strongest   most moving of the film    her presence brings a much deeper level of passion   and depth to the story   and though her appearances are relatively brief   the film would have suffered without her    also impressive are dicaprio and winslet   who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue   and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving    it s an old story   you know    forbidden love ala romeo and juliet    but it works   and jack s   rescuing   rose   in both literal and figurative senses   and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching    in fact   i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot   largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm   energy to the romance    it s engaging   touching and very enjoyable    there s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well   simply because you know it s not going to be a happy ending    which leads us to the second half of the film    we all knew it was coming    i m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it   because as he s stated in interviews   the real thrust of the story   for him   was the sinking   and the jack rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film    i think that understates the importance of the romance   as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die    the iceberg arrives   and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour    and it is an hour    my goodness   we don t miss a second of that hour    gratuitous   well   perhaps not by today s standards   i m sure there s been far worse produced under the banner of   entertainment   in other films    but i certainly wasn t prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be    not that i d expect the word   understatement   to be part of cameron s vocabulary   he who brought us such   umm   vivid films as   terminator 2   and   aliens        is it overdone    i thought so    understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy    no   no one expected a happy ending   but i didn t quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film s second half    still   whether it was overdone and heavy handed or not   if it was the shock factor cameron was after it worked   because i was shocked and moved   in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears    you really couldn t help but get emotionally involved   whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack   or that jack would rescue rose   or that they would both survive    perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk   and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface    the bit where rose lets go of jack s hand   while promising she ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart wrenching   and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image   to put no fine a point on it    i loved the ending   however   which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half    so   we ve established that the film is powerful and moving   if the last hour was rather excessive    haven t mentioned the script    plot wise it s ok   though the jack rose relationship was beautifully developed   but i ve a feeling that s to the actors credit if anything    as for the dialogue   well   titanic is set in 1912    it s a period drama    but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned    did they really use phrases like   goddamn it      back in the turn of the century    i doubt it    would someone talk like this     do ya love the guy or what        i doubt it    is such dialogue as   i saw the iceberg   and i see it in your eyes now   not just a bit   clumsy    yes it is    a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray   and cameron himself is to blame   he wrote the script      stick with directing   dude    but its more than redeemed by the acting   with dicaprio and winslet on fine form   ably supported by a strong cast    star of the show was gloria stuart   though    why didn t she win that oscar      after all   they were throwing oscars at   titanic   left   right and centre   but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee    directing wise cameron does a spectacular job    like i said   his vision was a bit excessive   but at least he directed it well    i haven t even mentioned james horner s beautiful score    utterly heavenly   though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it            i ve finished my rant   which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would    just leaves a couple of questions   was it worth all those oscars    hell   don t talk to me about oscars    bloomin  farce    it was deserving in a number of departments   though    last question   is it   as some suggest   one of the best films of all time    nope   i don t think so    it s certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i ve ever seen   but i don t think it quite ranks as one of my all time favourites    and as for the fact they re reportedly making a   titanic 2     well i guess that s typical hollywood for you    
239	0	there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been    the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944   where a one time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets   fists stuffed into coat pockets    to one side of him   residents scavenge for food in the street   to the other side   german troops beat a group of jews    jakob   however   never stops moving    it s an efficient   effective set up for the character   who is clearly nobody s idea of a hero at the outset    he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them   excising his moral peripheral vision    the set up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior    after a visit to a german commandant s office and a moment alone with a turned on radio   jakob learns that russian troops are quite near    when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews   they become convinced that he must have a radio   which is a punishable offense in the ghetto    the good news brings hope to the ghetto   the everyday specter of suicide vanishes    a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive    this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting   the   ordinary person   in question   jakob heym   is played by robin williams    i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his   serious   roles with every passing year    compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams   and see how much more mannered he has become   or   at the very least   how much less sensible at choosing material      jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions   but williams always looks like he s struggling  not  to craft them    when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10 year old orphan lina   hannah taylor gordon     he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky    oh yes   and then there s that little girl    some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero s fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful   but those scenes aren t problematic because they re familiar    they re problematic because they re jarring and distracting   introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn t have been about cutesy relationships    jakob s character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others   but there are plenty of others without poor little lina    every scene with her feels contrived   pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people    it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood ized holocaust   combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways    director peter kassovitz   working from jurek becker s novel   crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople   and draws solid performances from armin mueller stahl   as a once revered doctor   and bob balaban   as a barber drifting into depression      there are just too many things going on that prove distracting   whether it s the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter   or williams  incongrous presence   or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl    jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling   and has too compelling a central character to waste    and after one wonderful early scene   you can see the film wasted and fumbled away

513	0	14 years ago   national lampoon introduced us to a new family   the griswolds    in 1983   the griswolds embarked on a cross country journey with the destination of wally world   a world renowned theme park in california    we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured    two years later   we watched again as they went to europe   and four years after that   we shared christmas with them    now   eight more years have passed   and the laughs have done more than die    they ve been cremated    vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold   the good intentioned but ill fated father of two    the premise is basically the same    clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation   this time to las vegas    his wife ellen   beverly d angelo   and teenage kids rusty and audrey   always played by different actors   this time around   by ethan embry and marisol nichols   respectively   join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick    of course a   vacation   movie wouldn t be complete without good ole eddie   reprised by randy quaid     the misfit cousin   showing up at all the wrong times    there isn t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it    it s really just a skit movie    there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie   which is not a real term as far as i know    the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours   therefore coming off like a two hour skit    the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits   each lasting about five minutes    vegas vacation comes off like the first    a good example of the latter would be last year s black sheep    the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast   and it doesn t really fit into a movie mold    in these cases   a   plot     which is generally very thin   is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags   i   e    have a good vegas joke   make a vegas movie      such is the case with this movie s mini plots    clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold s money   ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton         rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage   and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie   shae d lyn   as an exotic dancer    the simple fact is   this movie isn t funny    at first   i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes   but when the movie got rolling   my interest suddenly stopped    chase plays clark griswold really well    he made the character and he is the character    d angelo   to be quite honest   never was too impressive as ellen   and this movie doesn t show any signs of redemption    as for the two new griswold kids   the word   blah   comes to mind    the   vacation   series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters   the simple reason being that there is nothing to them    they re so generic   you ll expect the credits to read   girl  1 as audrey griswold      vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor    yes   it s true that vegas vacation isn t even close to being close to being as funny as the others   which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways   but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart    first off   why did they leave off the national lampoon s heading on the title    i couldn t find any reasons why   but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn t want to be associated with such a lame film    that s saying a lot   especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented   loaded weapon 1   pcu   etc   if they expected this to be another hit   you would assume they d be proud to tack on the notorious header   but for reasons only we can guess at   like the movie sucking   they didn t    there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact    the first three films in the   vacation   series were written by john hughes   a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80 s including mr    mom   sixteen candles   the breakfast club   weird science   pretty in pink   ferris bueller s day off   planes   trains   and automobiles   and uncle buck    wowzers    what a r   sum      looking at the names   you d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980 s    well that s not all    this guy also brought us 90 s hits including the home alone series   the remake of 101 dalmatians   dennis the menace   and the current flubber    vegas vacation   however   didn t have john hughes behind it   and the loss is very obvious    this time around   the script is in the hands of elisa bell   whose only credits thus far include four made for tv movies    vegas vacation plays very much like one   and it would actually work much better as a made for tv sequel    if this sounds like a wild idea   it s not    revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies   and they seemed like it    vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2   00 a   m    sunday morning movie   but as a silver screen major motion picture   it s quite out of place    stephen kessler s jejune direction doesn t help things either    he only makes the film even more tv movie ish    each consecutive   vacation   movie has suffered a drop in directing power    we started the series off with harold ramis   who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co writing ghostbusters    not too bad    then we had national lampoon s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling   who would go on to direct the hits look who s talking and clueless   as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high    lastly we had national lampoon s christmas vacation   directed by jeremiah s   chechik   who went on to direct the charming benny   joon    kessler   so far   has one title under his belt   the short film birch street gym   which received an oscar nomination in 1992    granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film   we can allow for some amateurish quality   but instead we get a movie straight from the text book   boring   bland   and deeply unoriginal    if you loved the   vacation   movies   and i know   some   of us did   there still isn t anything here worth seeing    if you loved them   don t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte    if you never did like the series   why the need to confirm why    
749	0	in 1970s   many european intellectuals   especially those on the left political hemisphere   became obsessed with the rise of fascism    which wasn t so hard to expect   because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies    in such times   when political involvement could be associated with noble passion   many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany    of course   there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other   less noble reasons    for them   moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era    which   naturally   made some of those films very popular among teen audience    one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass   who later made career shooting expensive   stylish soft porn    salon kitty   his 1976 film   is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern   book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2    in 1939   walter schellenberg   one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite   exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats    none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents   and that all the rooms happened to be bugged    the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty   nominal madame of the brothel   didn t know the real purpose of that enterprise    screenplay by tinto brass   of course   simplifies the story and changes few names    schellenberg is now wallenberg   helmut berger     ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top    kitty kellerman   ingrid thulin     apart from being madam   has a second job as a cabaret singer    caught in the net of depravity is sweet   innocent girl margerithe   theresa ann savoy   thrown into brothel    there she falls in love with customer hans reiter   bekim fehmiu     disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe    when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel   she finds out that the place is bugged    she informs the madam of the real situation   and both women decide to confront wallenberg    those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film   that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation    but   although salon kitty doesn t happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn   although not very successful   some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing     it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict   this time between power hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty    unfortunately   brass seems to overuse other cinematical references   probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti s the damned   but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin s unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli s musical numbers from cabaret    all in all   salon kitty is failure   although with some very interesting moments

1609	1	us critic type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren t thrill rides   but i think that   back to the future ii   is one of the few exceptions    if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s   then this has the spirit of the 80s   full of fights   chase scenes   cliff hangers   special effects   some detective work   and of course the vision of the high tech future    the film picks up exactly where the first film left off   with doc   lloyd     marty   fox     and jennifer   elizabeth shue   travelling 30 years into the future   because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer s kids    doc tells marty he must take his son s place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr   says yes to griff   wilson   in one of four different roles      whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn t joking   especially when it comes to the movies    essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015   but it s not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself    at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better   and it seems like everything s copasetic right    wrong    since when do things go according to plan in the   back to the future   movies    there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won t even bother to list them all    basically we get to see marty as an old man   his house   his family   etc   we also go back to an alternate 1985   and then back again to 1955   with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath    the films  best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle    it s difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail    the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense    instead of a grand finale   we get lots of little victories    by the end everything is back to normal   but something happens that leads to yet another sequel   but it doesn t seem gratuitous       back to the future part ii   is a really great adventure movie    it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor

1370	1	titanic is   without a doubt   the best movie i ve seen all year    and believe me   i m not an easy critic to impress   the english patient was too long   men in black was over hyped   and several of the   big summer releases   were dead in the water    thank god this film got delayed until december    it s my christmas present    titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years gone by   and it is truly a stunning film    while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized   never taking your eyes off the screen   nor checking your watch to see how much longer it s gonna last   despite its 3 hour plus running time    as a friend of mine   who s a true titanic buff   said   if someone doesn t like this film   it s because they didn t want to      truer words are hard to come by    of course   it doesn t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors   james cameron   who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time    if you wish to argue that point with me   look at his list of credits   the terminator   aliens   the abyss   terminator 2   true lies   etc   still care to disagree    not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film   he also wrote   produced   and edited it    and to show his true faith for the project   he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs    it s obvious he truly loves titanic    the film opens with footage   both real and fake   of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic   where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the   heart of the ocean     which   according to bill paxton s character   would be worth more than the hope diamond today    their search turns up   dissapointly   no diamond   but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond    this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose   who claims to be the girl in the picture    she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond    almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past    rose s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl   engaged to a rich man named cal hockley   billy zane   that she didn t want to marry    her mother is pushy and obnoxious   and cal hockley is arrogant    they are boarding the titanic   which is sailing to america   and this is where she is to marry cal    meanwhile   a young man named jack dawson   leonardo dicaprio   and his italian friend   danny nucci   win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game    they are overjoyed   and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving    for them   this is their ticket to america   to a better life    for rose   she is sailing to her doom    the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt   kate winslet   and jack dawson fall in love    it s the classic wrong side of the tracks story   and does sometimes resort to a few cliches    but as i said above   the love portion isn t sappy and doesn t   weigh the film down     as some critics have said    it s sweet   and it didn t make me restless at all   despite the fact that i usually hate love stories    of course   it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen    most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912   including the enigmatic molly brown   played by the talented kathy bates     the captain of titanic   bernard hill     and so on    all of these characters add an extra depth to the film   and make it that easier to watch    of course   things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark   where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom    the sinking is depicted realisticly   and the effects are truly amazing    it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either   as people are portrayed as panicking   pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats   and drowning and dying horrible deaths    the best part of the movie   in my opinion   comes at the very end   when we flash back to the future    the crew   who at first had been skeptical of rose s story   now are totally aborbed by her    rose goes out onto the ship s ledge   and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard    we then see a dream of rose s   in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson    most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream    however   i think it symbolized more   i think it meant that rose had died   and is going to a sort of heaven   which would be the happiest part of her life   her and her one true love   jack    if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this   e mail me at venom8 hotmail   com    
1712	1	 run lola run    a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival   is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance    for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non stop movement   we follow a fiery haired heroine named lola   franka potente   as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers    lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100   000 marks in time to save manni   moritz bleibtreu   from being killed by the dealer    but   in something of a pseudo   groundhog day  approach   director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal    in these trio of episodes   we gradually learn the unique effects of fate   for even if tiny changes are made in lola s journey   the future can be seriously altered     run lola run  is an experience like  fight club  or  the matrix    in that each film takes you through a super charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways    in addition   all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack     lola  is no exception   with stylish quick flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get go    tykwer s world is a landscape of mood and color   with brilliant shades of red and pink   including lola s fiery hair   used as effective symbolism throughout    with it s visual style and mind blowing pace    run lola run  is one of the more invigorating movies of the year    even more so when considering the fact it s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81 minute time period    as a heroine   potente does little more than run wildly through the streets   as the title suggests     but she has a certain flair and charisma    her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star    meanwhile   bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life    both actors perform beyond the call of duty    the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola   and the outcome is ultimately rewarding   several twists and turns are unique and unexpected    the other characters lola runs into   both purposely and inadvertently   include her banker father   herbert kraup   and a friendly security guard   armin rohde     but aside from the two leads   no one has more than a few minutes of screen time    additional stars that couldn t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy   who are both responsible for the film s eye catching visual elegance     run lola run  is subtitled   so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning fast dialogue   occasional sections of it are especially fast    this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching    the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation    most are just chess pieces in tykwer s elaborate game of visual presentation   and he never really makes a significant move with any    but   the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay    a few petty gripes aside   this film is a wild   exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality    most people believe foreign films are mainly boring   talky character studies    perhaps  run lola run  will recharge their batteries    not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny   it also delivers a white knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity    like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character    run lola run  is exhausting

1037	1	unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi   an artist whose palette is fabric    ostensibly   the film is a documentary   but use of that term requires stretching its meaning    many scenes appear staged   and a great deal of cutting and pasting has been done in the editing room    the cinema verite effect is a conceit    genuine spontaneity is at a premium   and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera   especially would be actresses like cindy crawford      director douglas keeve   who was mizrahi s lover at the time   freely admits that he   couldn t care less about the truth   but was more interested in capturing   the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion      despite violating nearly every rule of   legitimate   documentary film making   however   unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment    while it sheds only a little light on the behind the scenes world of the fashion industry   it presents a fascinating   if incomplete   picture of designer mizrahi    this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study    he s funny   energetic   and eminently quotable    he has unusual views on just about everything   from fashion     it s about women not wanting to look like cows     to mary tyler moore     between her and jackie kennedy   they shaped this country     to style     it s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs        unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress    it s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine    the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look   including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies   then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection    in particular   unzipped traces mizrahi s development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show   which highlights a number of prominent models   including cindy crawford   naomi campbell   kate bush   and linda evangelista    on the technical side   a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped    a variety of film stocks were used   super 8   16 mm black and white   and 35 mm color    there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness    the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie   and   during the climactic fashion show   color is used to show the audience s perspective   while black and white is for the behind the  scenes sequences    nevertheless   some viewers will be put off by this treatment    while unzipped isn t an expose on the fashion industry per se   keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear    overall   however   this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else   and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed    when the designer declares that   everything is frustrating except designing clothes    that s beautiful and liberating     it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed

1818	1	in my review of there s something about mary   i said something to the effect of   laughter isn t everything      i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate   laughter isn t everything   unless i m watching a jim abrahams film    see   spoofs are easy with me    i love movies   and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love    sometimes i m the only one in the theater laughing    sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high pitched in comparison to my speaking voice   it cuts right through everyone else s laughter      sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film    abraham s latest film   mafia     induced this kind of hysteria upon me    it s gotten some mediocre reviews   but   hey   i m the guy who laughs at everything    there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film   but there are far more that work   and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness    i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought provoking    most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things   like develop characters   shape stories   and other such nonsense    mafia    has no pretentions about characters or story   and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh    the film begins on the perfect high note   with a mockery of the opening of casino    our hero   jay mohr   is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car   which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire    to describe the story of mafia    is absurd and pointless   but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films   with a lot of casino references inserted throughout    along the way   the parodies seem arbitrary   and rarely victimize mob films   pictures like the english patient   forrest gump   and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing    movies like this rely on just a few things   but the most important element is direction    abrahams has been down this path many times before   hot shots     top secret     airplane     and any other film with an exclamation point in the title     and so i hold most of the success of mafia    to his experience    he takes just the right attitude in each scene   and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references   one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic   but it never develops      the actors are all energetic   which helps a lot with the tone of the film    mohr   suicide kings   paulie     who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors   is so good here    he looks like he s having so much fun that he s containing his laughter in every scene   watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool      he s probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material    lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando s godfather   while pamela gidley is dead on in a full blown mockery of sharon stone    the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i m supposed to give examples of things and be specific    unfortunately   i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia    that i can t remember a lot of what made me laugh    but that s a good sign   mafia    is so funny that i wasn t even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory    i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain    i know that doesn t sound particularly complimentary   but when watching a dumb comedy like this   the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain    finally   a film that does this for me

1802	1	those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo s novel les miserables    i don t know if a lot of people have   though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel    i haven t even seen that    going into this film   i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters   i even expected the film to be a musical      walking away from it   i m kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material    writer director bille august s film version is a straightforward   beautifully told film    liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean   in the beginning   he has just been released from a 19 year prison sentence    he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior    the priest s words of wisdom influence him   and he makes a vow to change himself    nine years later   we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo   nobody knows his real name   and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago    conflicts arise when inspector javert   geoffrey rush   is assigned to vigo    valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him   and javert remembers jean to be a convict    javert is hell bent on upholding the law   and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice    along the way   valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman   fantine   uma thurman     and vows to take care of her daughter   cosette   played later by claire danes      les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture    the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast   and the sets don t look like sets   they look like real towns and villages     gabriella pescucci s costumes are noticeably spectacular    basil poledouris  soundtrack is thick and usually well placed   though it does get a bit heavy at times      many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality   such as the climax   which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening    augusts keeps the story simple   which i hear is a good thing   since the novel is so complex   and easy to follow    he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately    i was also impressed that he didn t go overboard with flash and style   which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days   such as baz luhrmann s vicious tragedy william shakespeare s romeo   juliet      this film feels solid and whole   and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested    liam neeson is terrific in the main role   neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well   and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective    thurman   in her small role   is very good   and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non glamorous role such as this one    rush is absolutely incredible as javert   i don t remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here   he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances   and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense    i can t be as charitable for danes   however   though i know she is a talented actress   here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit    les miserables is   as i ve said   a solid   intelligent motion picture    my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy   and perhaps too staged    each scene is grand and huge   and exploding with poledouris  score   but i didn t always want them to be    for the most part   les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture    it s a good movie   and tells its story well   but august tends to hand feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle    however   in a film this exciting and well produced   a few minor flaws are easily overlooked    
677	0	have you ever been in an automobile accident where you ve miraculously walked away with only a few scratches   yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable   mangled wreck    well   that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation    but after watching this inane exercise of a movie   i certainly feel that i ve miraculously walked away unscathed after a two hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond    oddly    eye of the beholder     which is a psychological romance thriller   starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent   called the eye   ewan mcgregor     working in washington dc    in the humorous opening scene   he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down    using an array of high tech surveillance and communications equipment   he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office    the law firm s employees get a good chuckle    the audience gets a good chuckle    the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman   ashley judd      there is something compelling about this mysterious woman    despite her glamorous looks   however   we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her    after the murders   she sobs while singing the christmas tune  little bluebirds  and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago    after each killing   she puts on a different wig   assumes a new name   and then makes her way to another state    the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions    but he does not alert the authorities    he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss    the eye   it turns out   also is haunted by his past    his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life    his tormented psyche creates a ghost like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation    she becomes a sort of spectral adviser   and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman    he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation    it doesn t matter that he has witnessed all of her murders    and it doesn t matter that the eye is abnormally reticent   hiding his entire life behind computer screens    he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble    when a crazed druggie   jason priestley   attacks her   he shows up for some quick butt kicking    when the police are closing in to arrest her   he provides a distraction so that she can escape    all the while   the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight    peculiar    how bad is this movie    i refer you to my  review quote source  litmus test    just take a look at the full page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes    for this movie   they are from magazines called  flaunt  and  mirabella      no doubt   they were impressed with judd s series of catwalks and disguise changes    the major problem with  eye of the beholder  is that the film jerks forward   always unsure of its ultimate destination    if it was a thriller   there was little to keep us entranced    if it was a love story   there was absolutely no emotional pull    completely disjointed in structure   it s only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial   the one where the  6  on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child s train set      i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents    beyond that   the film is hopelessly out of control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling    
1132	1	while watching wes anderson s rushmore   it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer   the film s anti hero   was not written with jason schwartzman in mind    the young actor   making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman    schwartzman plays max   a student who is more interested in his extra curricular activities   such as writing edgy plays like   serpico   and being president of the rushmore beekeepers   but sees his grades suffer as a result    on the brink of being thrown out   he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross   olivia williams   and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume   the great bill murray   to build an aquarium   on rushmore s baseball field   in her honour    unfortunately for everyone involved   blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well   which gets in the way of max s plans to woo her    max is one of the best written characters we ve yet seen in the 90s   and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age    as everyone else has probably already pointed out   he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman   although i was reminded more of paul from   the wonder years     from a visual standpoint   at least      hopefully   if he avoids typecasting as weird   quirky loner types he should earn himself a good career    bill murray is his equal as blume   displaying a depth we haven t yet seen from him    while this isn t his best performance   that honour goes to groundhog day   he is still terrific here    williams isn t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray   but still does fine work    rushmore seems to go just a little too long but   while it isn t a perfect film   it is a definate must see for anyone who wants to see that rarity   an american coming of age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality    anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should   with any luck   rise to even greater success    
425	0	from a major league baseball radio broadcast   featuring play by  play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown   with special guest commentator james berardinelli    hc   as we go to the top of the 8th   we re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli   who s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie   major league   back to the minors   the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors    nice to see you   jim    as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer   can you give us the scoop on the new flick    jb   my opinion   the producers should have stopped while they were ahead   and that was nine years ago    one entry was definitely enough   and i m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2   this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct to video    it s worse than a mediocre made for tv feature    i should also mention that this movie likely won t play all that well in cleveland    now that the real indians are perennial contenders   they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks    actually   most of the action involves the twins  aaa minor league club   the buzz   rather than the actual major league franchise    hc   sorry to interrupt   jim   but we still have to do play by play for the game on the field    leading off this inning is john warren    he steps into the batter s box and takes kent s pitch low for ball one    wh   so   the story s strictly minor league   right    what s it about    jb   scott bakula   the guy from quantum leap   plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell    when twins owner roger dorn   once again portrayed by corbin bernsen   needs a new manager for his aaa team   he offers the job to gus   who is now faced with two daunting tasks   turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson   played by walt goggins   for a promotion to   the show      with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano   dennis haysbert     rube baker   eric bruskotter     and isuro tanaka   takaaki ishibashi     gus gets the buzz on the right track    in fact   he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big league club   leonard huff   played with over the top relish by ted mcginley      soon   dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus  overachieving group against huff s overpaid   last place bunch    wh   can we guess who wins    jb   the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you ve already seen the box score    on top of that   none of the mock ups are presented with much flair    they re not just boring   they re lackluster    but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension   they ve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs    hc   warren fouls off a fastball    1 and 1    wh   are there lots of yuks in this one    jb   not one   from start to finish    i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny    okay   a lot of the jokes were sophomoric   but they made me laugh    the two sequels haven t just been stale   but their humor quotient has been abysmally low    even bob uecker s once sharp one liners have turned lame   and they re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing    hc   here s the 1 1 pitch    looooooong drive   fair or foul   foul ball    the count goes to 1 and 2    wh   does the film at least get the baseball details correct    jb   yes    there aren t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best ever baseball movies   the natural    but i d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story   believable characters   or even a little genuine humor    heck   the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league   back to the minors    wh   it s nice to see old friends one more time   isn t it    like cerrano   tanaka   and dorn    jb   depends on whether you really care that anyone is back    there aren t any real characters here   just an assortment of cliched oddballs    yeah   the voodoo hitter   the catcher who can t throw back to the pitcher   the japanese player   and the conceited player turned owner have all returned   but who really cares    they have no depth    notable absences include tom berenger s veteran and charlie sheen s   wild thing      we don t really miss them   though    hc   breaking ball   low and outside    2 and 2    wh   so you re saying that we should give this one a miss    jb   that s right    to use baseball terminology   it s a three pitch strikeout    if you re looking for a good movie that involves baseball   try popping the natural   field of dreams   bull durham   or even the first major league into the vcr    actually   this is an oddly timed release   since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters    even the minor league seasons are already underway    don t bother with major league   back to the minors    it s a wretched time  waster    wh   thanks for the advice    jb   you re welcome    hc   and here s the 2 2 pitch    fouled back   right into this booth    hey   jim   heads up    oops    somebody better get him some ice for that    he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies   but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls    odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him   almost as if he has a grudge to settle    anyway   back to the action on the field    
1171	1	virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre    since  dark city    1998     films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another    the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix    all the films released after it   have been less successful    david cronenberg s existenz   released only a couple of months after the matrix   was accepted and even appreciated   by some     but the hype was gone    and when  the thirteenth floor  aired this fall   it was completely overseen and ignored    i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying   feeling like eating the same meal over and over again    it was therefore i was less than excited   when i went out to see to  the thirteenth floor     however   i was positively surprised by josef rusnak s latest picture    matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality   combining the best of hollywood s action and effects with an intelligent story    existenz was a violent   gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality   ending in blood and madness     the thirteenth floor  is somewhere in between    instead of going after the crowds   the action audience   like the matrix     or aiming at the horror fans   like existenz      the thirteenth floor  presents a more intelligent plot   witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience   that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding    in a near future       on  the thirteenth floor of a classified building   a genius scientist   hannon fuller   has created a simulated world   his personal dreamworld   where every inhabitant is a complex   selflearning program that only believes it is real    right after the first testing of this world   fuller     is found murdered    douglas hall       his closest friend and business partner   immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth    a beautiful woman   gretchen mol   who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery   which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence    the first   download into simulation   is impressive    it is the creator s first visit to his world   his creation    in order to enter this virtual universe   you have to take over someone s identity   become another person    this is called conciseness transfer   and this is part of the tragedy in the film   people   wake up   in unknown places and strange things start happen    they start to doubt in their own sanity    these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their   users   and creators with their sanity and their lives    it is a frightening reality   the fact that all the people in the simulation   the program links   are living out their lives   oblivious   not knowing that they are puppets in someone s fantasy    with an appealing     blade runner     type   of detective story   this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present    our modern world is metal and glass    cold   unfriendly   impersonal    the thirties are different    colorful   beautiful   elegant   virile    this contrast demonstrates a wish for change    virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical   enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities    to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise   to some a personal playground    a life without any consequences    for others   a way to start over and   correct   their mistakes   by living in an illusion of their past    virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes   dreams and fantasies to life    at least that s how it is all beginning    but when you re waking up from your dream   the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise    this   almost narcotic effect   soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness    some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised    what is real    what is thought    who are we    if these were answered   this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made    they are off course not answered   but posed in an intelligent manner    the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements   since it portrays the contrast between these computer simulated universes    kirk m   petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour   grace and color   and setting this world in opposition to our own    an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties    there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time    a rather unusual thing about the thirteenth floor  is the almost complete lack of special effects    there are no cgi animated creatures   no bullets in slow motion    this is a more philosophical approach   reminding about the european way of filmmaking    this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians   but the more serious science fiction buffs and  dark city  fans will be pleased    this film is interesting and inspiring    it has everything existenz doesn t   but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix    and then there is a happy end which   like in  dark city    completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context    the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think   since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics   including blade runner and  dark city     with this in mind    the thirteenth floor  doesn t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now   yet this is a beautiful   elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality    
1088	1	are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store    wafflemovies   com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves    everyweek   wafflemovies   com  reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video    here is a sample review    welcome to sarajevo  in light of america s recent intervention in kosovo   welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years    set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events   this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war    the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding    as they make their way down the street   a sniper shoots the mother of the bride    yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war    in this scene   we meet joe flynn   woody harrelson     an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church    joe is cocky   but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn t even know    his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson   stephen dillane      michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world s lack of interest    henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother s death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread    he decides to take action when a united nations  delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth    henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines    he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult    during his visits   he befriends a pre teen girl   emira   emira nuseric   who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner    he promises to get emira out of harm s way if he gets the chance    after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children   henderson loses hope    however   his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina   marisa tomei   and her children s aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans    unfortunately   only babies are wanted for adoption   so henderson pledges to take emira to england    the group of children   nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy    can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps    the movie was beautifully and sensitively made    director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred    they show the destroyed lives   families that have been split up   and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with    this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson   his producer and flynn have befriended    the group of twenty somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life s simplest pleasures and amenities    one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth    like the rest of those deeply effected by the war   this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live    winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room    the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics    winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities    this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies   com  selection mad city    we watch them struggle to cover the horror   while trying to remain professionally detached    however   they are human and question the reason behind it all   why no one cares   and how they can get out    stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson    he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events    dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy    henderson realizes that he cannot save the world   but he can help a few    it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary sandra bullock disaster two if by sea    woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest   most versatile actors of his generation    harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character s caring nature and vulnerability shine through    harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men   cheers   white men can t jump   as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one    this ability will serve him well and give him a long   successful career    america s involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place    for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict   the entire movie   most importantly the opening scenes   provide a history lesson    war is a foreign concept to most of us in america    battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to    televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war    this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world   something we don t do enough of in 90 s america    
1444	1	seen august 8   1998 at 6 p   m   at rotterdam square cinemas   rotterdam   ny     theater  6   by myself for free using my sony loews critic s pass     theater rating           good seats   sound   and picture   war is a topic that can t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media    movies   documentaries   and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on   such as strategy   politics   and victory    it s easy to forget war   in its most basic form   is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other    forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier   no matter what his rank or importance   is a real flesh and blood person and not just a number       saving private ryan   is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect   especially in its unapologetic   realistic delivery    it proves there s a huge difference between battling and killing    the film opens with one of the most graphic   disturbing scenes in recent memory    it s world war ii   d day to be exact   and the u   s   military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them    spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality    instead of positioned cameras   the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared    there is no sense of stability   but of constant   anxious   and confusing motion   giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle   and just a vulnerable as the poor troops       poor   is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are    there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters    we don t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles   but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding    the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated   but as people that must be destroyed because they re there    in the movies   the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch   but in reality that wouldn t happen    the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies    they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well secured germans who can actually see who   what   and where they re shooting   unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off    perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are   but that seems to be part of the theme    the film seems to rely on the audience s sense of patriotism   that the american military is   right   and good and that the nazis are   inherently evil      the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold   a whole 50 foot progression     and begin to inflict some damage    i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up   i couldn t help but feel some sense of joy and relief    to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure   but there s nothing cliche about the graphic   detailed   atmosphere here because it really happened    one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is   and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting    the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet    tom hanks stars as captain miller   a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon    he s never obsessive or any such generic   cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this    he doesn t want to be there any more than his men   but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out    the mission the film is concerned with is   as the title states   saving private ryan    through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker   it is brought to a general s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each s death simultaneously    when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe   they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother    it s easy to sympathize with this situation   after all   no one should have to lose all their children at once    but finding one man in this war is   as miller puts it     like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles      the saving of private ryan isn t just a dramatic device   but a thematic one    his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country   the world even   was trying to convince itself it still had    when miller s company hears of the mission   they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead   but miller isn t so quick to shrug it off    he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope   and now he has the opportunity to make someone s sense of hope a reality    the mission to find ryan gives miller s group a destination   but not direction    along the way many things happen to them   both good and bad    a few battles are fought   not to be major accomplishments for the war   but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice    the act of killing itself becomes one of the film s major philosophical metaphors    the soldiers don t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle   but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go   they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses    unfortunately   death is a fact of war   and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters   but here spielberg doesn t want us to think these men are invincible    in fact   only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man   and the performances are good enough to make this method work    although the characters are somewhat typical   the actors maintain control over the material at all time    whether they re arguing with each other   telling stories of back home   or fighting the germans   they never go overboard and always seem believable    sure   there s a zinger here and there   but war doesn t change the fact boys will be boys    if and when one dies we too can feel the loss   even though we hardly knew them    the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous   violent battle sequence    private ryan has been found   but facing four to one odds   can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive    that s not a premise for thrills   it s symbolic of everything the film has worked for    it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending   it ends the way it must end    i remember reading a   calvin   hobbes   comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like     dad   how do armies of men killing each other solve problems         saving private ryan   is the adult version of that question    
1381	1	in tim burton s  sleepy hollow    there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name    he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe    burton s update on washington irving s classic tale of  the legend of sleepy hollow  offers us the mystery of the horseman   when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror    writer andrew kevin walker    seven    throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes   but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing   as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine    as  sleepy hollow  opens   we re greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau   who won an oscar in burton s  ed wood     landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow   who   on a fateful carriage ride through the forest   is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider    after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town   constable ichabod crane   johnny depp   is sent in to investigate    landlord baltus von tassel   michael gambon   explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case   and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper   played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken   who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods    crane is not a man of great superstition   and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets   things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie      first and foremost    sleepy hollow  is a fun horror film    as with virtually all burton movies   we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman   who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly    the horseman f x are stylish and impressive   particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors    but why did i enjoy  sleepy hollow  as much as i did    although enjoyable   it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right      it was the light comic touch that burton applied    the film has the sweetness of a candy apple   usually channeled through depp s wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane   who is no longer a mild mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities    this is certainly not the only alteration that s been made    as the film progresses   it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves    the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together   because for the audience   it s not an issue we particularly wish to be solved    it s more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive    still   we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton s keen eye to capture our attention    the costuming is exceptional   and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout   it s recognizable that the script was refined by award winning playwright tom stoppard      the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many    a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel s daughter katrina   and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent    walken   michael gough   who appeared in burton s  batman  films   and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles    i suppose the strengths behind  sleepy hollow  lie within the central trio   director burton   constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy    all of this is not to be taken seriously   of course     sleepy hollow  is a lavish   frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children    if you ve got a decent head on your shoulders   you ll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time

1913	1	usually when a blockbuster comes out   it s loaded with effects   stars   bad scripts   and plenty of action    mystery men may contain an all star cast   and efects   but the clever script and characters are what really works   which is rare to see this year    the film is based upon the comic book series   the flaming carrot   by bob burden   in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime   only to be out done by the real hero of champion city   captain amazing   greg kinnear      things go a little haywire   when the sinister casanova frankenstein   geoffrey rush   is released into the city   where he captures captain amazing   and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city    well   the trio decide to take matters in their own hands   by saving the city   but first they need some assitance    this is where the film takes a turn for the better    in the beggining   there were only 3 wanna be heroes       blue raja   hank azaria       mr   furious   ben stiller   and   the shoveller   william h   macy      sure they were enterataining   but their acts grew old fast    that is until they aquire   invisible boy     kel mitchell     and   the bowler     janeane garafalo   and   mr   splein     paul reubens     2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess    thankfully   the original 3 heroes become amusing   with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen    the whole premise is rather ridiculous   but packs a few punches to keep interest    for one   the film is considerably clever    it literally pokes fun at super hero films   like batman and robin   superman etc   in fact   many scenes are similar to batman and robin   including the opening sequence   only altered in a humorous and superior way    a part of the cleverness comes from the cast    sometimes a film with such talent is overblown   but the acting is what keeps it alive here    while azaria and macy were enteratining   2 characters really stood out    one was paul reuben    no matter how disgusting or revolting   mr   splein   may be   you still can t help but laugh    it  so incredibly moronic   it s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions    janeane garafalo also was an interesting character    she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem   due to her enthusiasm   that kept the film flowing    men is worth seeing alone   for those 2 troubled heroes    on the downside   a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off    kel mitchell and geoffrey rush   were both utterly useless    their parts were so limited   they d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes    ben stiller too was wasted   mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue    none of these characters get a rise out of anybody   but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film    as far as the budget goes   it was wisely spent on the cast   not the effects    while the set designs and action all look nice   i m glad there was a seperate aspect   that the film focused on   and for that i applaud    slow at times   and rather pointless   mystery men still delivers    it forgets about money making   because it s not likely to make a bundle like it s proceeders   and that s what works    stupid    maybe   but for once i m not disappointed    no one expected an intelligent film   but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year    
1016	1	the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do    lives are often at stake   and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable   prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment s notice    the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor   psychologist   and sham artist   in addition to being a police officer   he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence   or failing that   must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower    most of all   the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible   and quickly gain control of the situation   dominate the conversation   and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants    it takes a pretty smart person to do that    but what if the hostage holding criminal is just as smart    what if he s also able to think on his feet    in fact   what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor    it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f   gary gray s the negotiator    in this film   police negotiator danny roman   samuel l   jackson   is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force    when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman s home   roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder    faced with the scorn of most of the police department   and under close scrutiny by the media   roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain s office    i don t quite remember if the captain actually said     i hate to do this   but            although it wouldn t surprise me if he did    luckily   the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above    after being offered a take it or leave it deal by the district attorney   roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum   j   t    walsh     taking him and others hostage   and proclaiming he has been framed    although roman s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up   gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian   kevin spacey   which soon ensue    jackson   while a superb actor   is miscast in the role of roman    the actor has become so popular   and so often identified as a protagonist   notable exceptions can be found   such as in jackie brown     that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats    the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence    how can we believe he s going to shoot a hostage   no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier    unfortunately   this preconception saps the film of some of it s would be suspenseful moments   and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson s acting ability    almost every time he s in a scene   jackson steals it without looking back    when spacey appears   the film has already run about a third of its course    his is an interesting character    made out to be some kind of negotiating superman   our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation       i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower   but i can t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone     he says    when he gets the call to action   however   he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be    soon   his character has to negotiate not only with roman   but also with the swat commander   david morse   who is itching to send in a team to take roman out   all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation   should negotiations fail    this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor    as the second protagonist   spacey measures up nicely    gray really lucked out with this cast    david morse as commander beck   ron rifkin as commander frost   and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent   and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey    the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices   morse played a similar role in the rock   rifkin played the d   a    in l   a   confidential   and spencer played a police detective in cop land    with the level of acting   however   this can be forgiven    also in the supporting cast   paul giamatti as rudy   one of the hostages   is notable for the comic relief he provides    his character is initially so slimy   and giamatti himself just looks so shifty   that you expect to laugh before he even says anything    fortunately   this doesn t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film   but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout    j   t   walsh   as the suspicious internal affairs inspector   clocks in with one of his final performances    sadly   the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year   and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film    walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam   backdraft   and nixon    for one of his best performances   check out sling blade   in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton    when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march   walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success   the actors performed together in a few good men      the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh   and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role   it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing    in the end   the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it s reality    we re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best    as an audience   we re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie   and we d like to see if one will dominate the film    both provide some pretty good entertainment    
1120	1	plot   a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes    he is taken prisoner along with some other humans   and tries his best to escape his simian captors    oh yeah   and did i mention that the apes can talk    kewl    critique   despite this film not looking like a   tim burton movie   or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself   i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun   summer fare    although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make up jobs and characterizations    i mean   i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real    i also have to   give it up   to all of the actors inside the costumes   not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make up slobbered all over them for 2 4 hours   but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well    i especially enjoyed bonham carter s performance   who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film   human or ape   and tim roth s bad guy   who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part    plot wise   i liked the beginning of the film   the whole build up once wahlberg got into the village   the escape and most of the fight scenes   but once things got out into the deserted area   and the final battle sequence     i kinda lost a bit of my interest    i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of   human beings as animals   then i was about the end battle sequence   which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film    i also hated the   kid   character who just got on my nerves and didn t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved   i won t ruin it here but c mon guys       you  coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that   no        but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character   his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter species love interests    this dude didn t seem to give a rat s ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn t really care about what happened to him either    now i m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script   but the film suffered because of it    visually   the movie was also nice to look at   especially the apes       but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton    the   surprise ending   that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968   felt a little tacked on here   and despite being interesting   didn t really make all that much sense to me   unless you look at it from a sequel point of view      so overall   i loved the whole   feel   of the planet   the apes that ruled it   the manner in which they treated the humans   screamed   shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain   but didn t appreciate the film s lack of human character development   why was kris kristofferson even in this movie     and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring    but i would still recommend this film as a fun   summer movie with laughs   creepiness and a really cool premise    ps   for anyone who has seen the original   i cannot believe that they didn t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character   in this case   mark wahlberg   goes nuts at the world in which he s suddenly been thrust     this is a mad house        type of thing      the guy in this film barely seems to be   put off   by the fact that he s surrounded by apes who can speak english      where s joblo coming from    the arrival   8 10     battlefield earth   7 10     godzilla   4 10     instinct   6 10     mission to mars   3 10     pitch black   7 10       1968   planet of the apes   9 10     sleepy hollow   8 10    
757	0	battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000   and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close    in fact   i ll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years    based on the novel by scientology guru l   ron hubbard   battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information    it s the year 3000   and an alien race called the psychlos   which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers   conquered our planet in nine minutes    ok   we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind    when were we conquered    the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1   000 years earlier   and if that is the case then we re going to get into a whole bunch of problems later   trust me        keep reading      also   why don t we get to see earth get conquered    how the hell do you make a popcorn sci fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film    humans now live as cavemen or slave labor   and for the film s first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver   colorado    they grunt and groan and babble about monsters    so   when the psychlos conquered earth   were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills    none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered   whenever that was      this is definitely not the way to start an action sci fi film    one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster   and he begins to fight it    the   monster   turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course    he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course   with some shrubs growing over them    so   in 1   000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time   with only a few weeds growing over it    anyway   some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl   john travolta   a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit    the cavemen   led by barry pepper   are forced to do their bidding or whatever   but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet   or something    so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1   000 years earlier    and   we re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can t even handle a few cavemen    one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos    so jets left unattended for 1   000 years are still able to fly    please   if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood    why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway    shouldn t they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us    the psychlos refer to humans as   man animals   but yet dogs are still   dogs      why aren t they   dog animals      the psychlos are after mining earth s precious resources   but for 1   000 years are unaware of fort knox    why do i even care at this point    i m a fan of travolta s and i m glad to see he s back on the a list in hollywood   despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon      but how did he possibly think this was a good movie    and how did he think he was giving a good performance here    he s more than capable of making a menacing villain   see broken arrow and face off   but whenever his character came on screen i couldn t hold back my laughter    now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have   travolta just looks like travolta    all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face   but travolta just has a goatee    also   travolta s acts with a sort of phony upper class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world    ooooo   scary villain    as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better    you can make a dumb but good sci fi film   i love independence day for example     but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth    i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening        i cleaned my glasses   walked around the theater   made a grocery list   chose my lottery numbers for the week   replayed super bowl xxv in my head   with commercials          and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids    by the time we actually reach the year 3000   people should still be avoiding this film    folks   save your cash      don t go see it   don t rent it   and don t buy it    you d be more entertained by taking the money you d use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind   watching it sail away   hell   send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal        we ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money      unless of course you re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running   which is just about all you ll come away with from this movie    that   and a headache     editor s note   for some reason though   the day after my screening i converted to scientology    i m not sure why        something just made me feel compelled make the choice

1160	1	with more and more television shows having gay characters   and even the infamous   ellen   sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian   the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines    the birdcage was critically acclaimed   as was this years chasing amy    then along came in   out   and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released    it s also noticeable that this   alternative lifestyle   becomes less and less taboo as the years go by   and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort    while it s a very serious issue to many   it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety    but the way we re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically    while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh   at     it is more and more becoming something we laugh   with     and when a movie like in   out comes along   it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy    it doesn t poke fun at the lifestyle   it simply uses it to all it s comedic capacity   just as love   sex   marriage   birth   death   and anything else has been    the idea for in   out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids afflicted gay man in philadelphia    if you remember   during his acceptance speech   hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community   and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life    it s a serious and touchy subject   but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy   and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick    it s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual   it may have been more controversial   but because it was written by an openly gay writer   the prerogative was set    kevin kline   who only seems to become more and more acclaimed   stars as howard brackett   a high school english teacher in the small   picturesque town of greenleaf   indiana    after a three year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery   joan cusack     a wedding date has been set   and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story   greenleaf high graduate cameron drake   matt dillon   is up for a best actor oscar    the small town eagerly awaits both events   and both seem quite astronomical   but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other    when cameron drake is announced the winner   the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher   mr   brackett    everyone is cheering back in greenleaf   that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words     and he s gay      the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop    the thing is   nobody   including howard   can understand how cameron came to that conclusion   and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf    naturally the questions pour from howard s fiancee   parents   debbie reynolds   wilford brimley     students   and the high school s principal   tom halliwell   bob newhart     and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious   howard is clean   neat   honest   sincere   a romantic   and perhaps the most incriminating fact   he loves barbara streisand    the frenzy isn t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and   entertainment tonight   wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning    one particular reporter is peter malloy   tom selleck   of   inside entertainment     who unlike the collage of other reporters   wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett   including coverage of his wedding    the intrusion is all but welcome by howard   who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute    it seems that no matter where he turns   a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees    the dominoes begin to tumble as howard s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay    it all sounds very devastating   and it would be if it weren t presented with near perfection by one of this year s most delightful ensemble casts    kline seems only to improve with age   and he is downright perfect here    the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine   and they use it wonderfully    every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever    dillon has never been so likeable   cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role   and brimley   reynolds   and newhart all provide huge laughs when they re up to bat    rudnick s script is heavily laced with wit and humor   and you ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes    while in   out doesn t carry enough to give it four stars   it remains one of the best done films of the year   all around    the script is exuberant   the actors are absolutely top  notch   and we re allowed just the perfect blend of heart tugging so as not to bog down the laughs    it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety   yet we re still allowed a sappily touching ending    despite it s subject matter   and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex   this is a movie that everyone could   and should   enjoy    frank oz   best known as a voice talent for muppets   directs this film quite delightfully   using all the potential rudnick s script has to offer   which turns out to be quite a bit    check this one out    you ll have a gay old time    
466	0	warner brothers   rated pg 13   mild violence   sexual situations     132 minutes  director   luis mandoki  screenplay   gerald di pego   from the novel by nicholas sparks    cast   kevin costner   robin wright penn   paul newman   illeana douglas   robbie coltrane   jesse james   john savage    review by   geoff berkshire  i m not an overly cynical guy    there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years    however   i have my limits and i also have standards    this brings us to the subject at hand   message in a bottle   the big ticket romance that warner brothers  unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine s day    the story   what little of it that there is   involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne   robin wright penn   dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason   jesse james      during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean    the letter   written to a mystery woman named catherine   instantly captivates her    upon her return   theresa shares it with her best friend lina   illeana douglas     her boss charlie   robbie coltrane     and the entire city of chicago   the newspaper publishes an article about it      it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake   kevin costner   and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down    he turns out to have a colorful father   paul newman   but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing    this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship    of course she doesn t tell him that she found his letter   she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later   preferably right after they first make love      this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened    the discovery of the message and garret s discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film    there s a truly lame subplot about garret s relationship with his dead wife s family   he gets into a bar fight with her brother   played by john savage   and then the necessary tear jerking ending    a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die   although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel    the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced   and unintentionally humorous   sequences filmed since        well   since costner s the postman   1997      message in a bottle is one slow moving film    last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this    they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work    message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they re fighting the material all the way   and losing badly    costner and   especially   wright penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring    they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry    the supporting players are given very little to do    the reliable douglas is particularly wasted    old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film    a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played    however   too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are    the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story    gabriel yared   who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient   1996   and city of angels   1998   with his scores   overdoes it a bit here    caleb deschanel s camera makes everything look a little too beautiful    do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly    the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times    the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego    working from a best  selling novel by nicholas sparks   which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county     di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times    its strict adherence to clich   s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer   1998      there simply isn t an original scene in this film    the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking    this is director mandoki s first film since when a man loves a woman   1994     the solid meg ryan andy garcia romance    he s simply going through the motions with this    message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come   1998   as one of the most misguided romances of the decade    
380	0	it should have been a classic    a great cast of respected supporting actors    an interesting premise of loser comic book characters    however     mystery men   proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999    the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals    the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise    the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh out loud joke and mediocre small jokes   it failed miserably at being entertaining at all    the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons    they had been used a number of times before in previous films   the best ones   which were mediocre to begin with   were ruined in the trailer   and the expectation of laughing at clever   unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film       mystery men   might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business    but with veterans doing this kind of junk   it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought    thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie    the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy    the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero   captain amazing   who has recently captured every evil doer in the city    captain amazing   played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear     because of his success in the past   is worried that he will lose popularity    after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city   geoffrey rush   overacting just a bit too much   to keep himself busy   things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured    it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day    by the time this section of the plot is finished   the interest for what happens   if you haven t already figured it out   is very low    there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention    the first scene in the film   which shows the wannabes trying to save the day   feels like it was seriously edited down    right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk s home by some masked goons   captain amazing comes in and saves the day   or ruins the movie    instead of editing this scene   more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr   furious   ben stiller   and monica   a waitress   claire forlani   or the vast majority of the film   which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was    a simple rule   more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work    another major problem with   mystery men   is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances    the film depended on its cast to work fluently together   like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion    however   most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way    to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat   paul reubens   who disappeared from acting to everyone s joy   returns here leaving very little to be impressed about    as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon   all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes    fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of   american pie   and   there s something about mary         mystery men   drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining    anyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way    so why continue to watch    this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure       mystery men   indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says   i knew you could do it         mystery men   fails in every category it attempts to pass    what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable    terrible acting   terrible script   and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors       i m unpredictable      an overexcited ben stiller shouts out    no ben   you re the complete opposite

1301	1	expectation rating   a bit worse than expected   mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull      roger ebert gave it a four star review   and while he is a critic that uses the full scale   and i often agree    such as dark city being the best film of 1998   he must have seen a better film    i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it    the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter    the landscape is snowy and cold   and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner   which also reminds me of fargo   which i loathed        one can almost sense the cold    but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead   instead raimi has made a more constrained film    which probably is for the better    this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots    the movie also reminded me of affliction   as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father   and they see a chance for such a dream to come true    this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field   where an airplane has crash landed    in the plane three men find   the american dream        in a gym bag      affliction too was set in a snowy landscape    it really seems very simple    just hold on to the money until spring   and if no one claims it   they ll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true    but the snow melts   and so might several of the character s hopes    as in   return to paradise     some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing    but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish    the movie s biggest strength is that it fact makes sense    i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized   eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story    for example clear and present danger    the biggest problem seems to over familiarization with the story    the writer perhaps feels that he doesn t have to present scenes that are clear to him   but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book    this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan   even though the screenplay is by the book s author    the movie is always clear on where it s going   and always makes sense    i m sue a lot was cut   but really i can t remember what    even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included    the man only comes in on mondays   but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many    turns out        well   see the movie    one should be warned against seeing the trailer    it reveals several scenes from the ending moments   which yes   like in the book   it is a downer     several plot developments   and much of the beginning    but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer   so if you re lucky   you ll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie

1811	1	driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small   intimate story    it s a quiet film   a slow film   a deliberate film    but if you re patient with it   the movie offers innumerable rewards   such as a pair of self assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy    driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry s pulitzer prize winning play of the same name   which first opened in new york four years ago    the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago   los angeles   london   vienna   norway   and the soviet union    uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy   he also penned the wonderful sleeper   mystic pizza    the film   like the play   is set in atlanta   georgia   and it revolves around two people in their twilight years   a cranky   70 something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60 something black man who becomes her chauffeur    the movie relies on character   rather than plot   to propel the action    in fact   the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense   it doesn t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together    rather   driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life   shopping   listening to the radio   visiting the cemetery   eating fried chicken   and so on    the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta s history   including the 1958 bombing of the temple   the city s oldest jewish congregation   and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr   martin luther king   jr    the story begins in 1948 with daisy   tandy   crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway    the insurance company cancels her insurance   and her son   boolie   decides to hire her a chauffeur    freeman   reprising his role from the play   plays the chauffeur   hoke    the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger    driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature   aging   prejudice   and a great many other things   but more than anything it s about a relationship   one that spans 25 years   4 cars   the advent of civil rights   and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon    daisy is strong willed and set in her ways   and   from the outset   she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur    initially   she treats hoke with contempt   refusing to let him drive her anywhere    once she does get in the car   daisy is the ultimate back seat driver    to make matters worse   she is extremely self conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand    eventually   however   daisy is worn down by hoke s good natured charm and infectious cheer   she softens and opens up to him    tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well   but unfortunately this feisty   cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace    we ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations   from on golden pond to cocoon    nevertheless   tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own    freeman   as hoke   on the other hand   gives the more distinctive of the two performances    there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color    hoke is uneducated and illiterate   but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man   an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior    both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element   in full command of their natural charisma    they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves    they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie s gentle humor    at the same time   tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama    in his first dramatic role   dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie   tandy s loving and patient son    drama seems to agree with aykroyd   taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor   especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently   ghostbusters ii   the great outdoors   my stepmother is an alien      the only other significant characters in the film are daisy s housekeeper   idella   marvelously played by esther rolle     good times       and boolie s pretentious wife   played by patti lupone    under the direction of bruce beresford   crimes of the heart   tender mercies     driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again    but fortunately   beresford never forgets he s shooting a movie   and accordingly   he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches   such as gorgeous shots of flowers   trees   and tomatoes    in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen   the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety    uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say    beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film s dramatic moments    the movie tugs at your heart   but it never goes for the jugular    the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees    
1732	1	the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and   real   movies    consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved    lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste    top flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety    based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks   the movie represents a rethinking of the story s structure   not merely a literal adaptation of the novel    told in linear form by four narrators in the book   egoyan s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator    the author is even on record as applauding egoyan s changes    in the press notes the book s author describes the story as   a parable of lost children      he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children    picking up on this   egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter   nicole burnell   played with grace by sarah polley   reads parts of   the pied piper   from an old   illustrated book to her two charges    periodically throughout the picture   nicole s readings are heard in voice over    you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment    they and the rest of the town s children come into harm s way    some live and others are seriously injured    and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again    although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children   the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss    ian holm   in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career   plays mitchell stephens   an intense man of quiet misery    mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small   snow encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness    his mission there is a singular one   to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone   anyone   on their behalf    if this seems crass   well it is   but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot    the story unfolds slowly and always believably    each little aspect has its own fascination    as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker   played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson   he has a simple task    he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit    wendell ticks off one town member after another and then   as one can in a small town   enumerates each person s numerous faults    although the town is no peyton place   people there do have their foibles    one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell   bruce greenwood     who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good bye to his kids    well   single parent billy s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita    his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story    the accident itself   a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice   isn t shown until the middle of the picture   but   nevertheless   the mystery about it builds throughout the film    although the picture is no detective story   finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy    as the injured bus driver   gabrielle rose   dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning    to round out the story   mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear    his daughter zoe   caerthan banks   is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half way house and recovery center after another    fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help   she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk         i can help you     mitchell tries to reassure billy       not unless you can raise the dead     billy snaps back    mitchell s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder      mychael danna s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy    the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur   but it is in the warm   shadowy   intimate moments indoors where it works best    the show   which is ripe for emotional manipulation   never plays with its audience    still   when the house lights go up   you may feel as i did    i could barely breathe   i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed    more than anything   the film is like a master painting    each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint    with the final color in place   the masterpiece is complete   and the ending credits roll    the sweet hereafter runs 1   50    it is rated r for mature themes   sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers    
851	0	ironically   one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life    unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest   because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes   watching this sad excuse for a movie    actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn t be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie    not only is it a pathetically bad film overall   but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever    the plot is scattered   thin and predictable   the acting is monumentally bad   and the style of film making resembles a home video    it is december 31   1981 and the big party is at monica s   martha plimpton   house    but no one has arrived yet    her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups    some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica   and some are total strangers    but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night s end    those who are invited are the ones that have the issues    it is up to those who aren t to help them come to terms    first there is eric   brian mccardie   who is a former boyfriend of monica s and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance   or lack thereof    he is one of the most bland characters   in a film full of dullness   because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical   a common trait of this poor production    bridget   nicole parker   and caitlyn   angela featherstone   who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year s eve and tag along to the party with them    they stumble across a nameless bartender   ben affleck   who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections    he is nether sexually deprived   nor uncertain about his future   as he is in law school    his lack of flaws is both boring   unrealistic and painful to watch    as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub standard comedy    moving on   there is val   christina ricci   and stephie     gabby hoffman   2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts    val is monica s cousin and a true fan of the new york scene    on the other hand   stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can t find    paradoxically   it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar   actually they attempt to flee from their presence   but aren t successful   who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds    of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples   only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot    wisely   the movie s creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy   courtney love   and kevin   paul rudd   who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless    paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie   janeane garofalo   and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship    however   the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends   and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening    finally   there are the two worst performances and worst sub plot of the film    jack   jay mohr   and cindy   kate hudson   have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy s virginity the night before    while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self   he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy    very often   when a film is as putrid as this production   there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory    however   this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted    instead   what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts   bad continuity and inaccuracies    first   and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another   there is no apparent order that it follows   and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot    at other times   objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot    there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish    not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver    and yet   no matter how miserable this film may be   and no matter how poor the acting is all around   there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots    perhaps   if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or   perhaps   even three   there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development   or quality acting   or even a decent plot payoff at the end    but it didn t happen that way    the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance   and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight    
650	0	   there s nothing new under the sun   is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means   let s find something to copy      of course there are very few completely original ideas    even earth shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience    there is   after all   no need to re invent the wheel time after time    recently it seems that hollywood doesn t feel the need to even re write the script    my understanding of the word   sequel   is a continuation of the story    the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes    have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma s adaptation of the steven king novel    this is your dream come true    rachel   emily bergl     a high school outcast   is beginning to notice weird things happening around her    doors slam shut by themselves    glass globes blow up    her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent    a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out    the in crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event    any of this sound familiar    once the audience catches on that this is the same story as   carrie     there s little to do but wait for the inevitable ending    the effects are a bit better this time around   but the film doesn t work nearly as well    there are a couple of minor plot differences    rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized    the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original    they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest    and   uh   there must be other story changes but none stand out    one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell    over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie    now a high school counselor   she befriends rachel   but her character s potential is squandered    there s too much about sue that doesn t make sense    after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates   sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel s mother is in    still living in the same small town   the woman with a well known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor    sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease    this may be the one original idea in the film   but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a   disease   is never explained    sue s eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn t figure out what to do with her    blink and you ll miss it    some of the events are filmed in black and white   but the rationale for this is unknown    it doesn t add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random       the rage   retains some of the trappings of   carrie   without the meaning    in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie s onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating    here there s an abundance of red   but for no apparent purpose    the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin    one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds    the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original    seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film   and the flaws in this one

1914	1	review  peter jackson s the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie   and still coming in at the extremely cheap  30 million price tag    but for those who were dismayed by this year s blockbusters like twister and independence day   the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects    and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily    the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high profile movie can get    michael j   fox stars as frank bannister   a con artist who can speak to ghosts    he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people   then he comes and pretends to get rid of them    this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago    frank s latest customers are a young couple   played by trini alvarado and peter dobson    when dobson ends up dead   alvarado starts to take an interest in fox    but dobson s spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he s dead    this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado   with dobson tagging along as a ghost    things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town    fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims   but noone else can see that    so when fox shows up to try and save each victim   naturally people suspect he is the killer    fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector s hit list   and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox s attempts to save her from this evil spirit    there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh    the movie starts off as a black comedy   and ends up a horror action film    the mix between these genres are perfect    no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror   and vice versa    one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman    but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form    michael j   fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife s death   and then is forced to confront this later on    alvarado   looking like andie macdowell   makes a great frightened   tough   and smart heroine    and jeffery combs   as a paranoid fbi agent   is brilliantly bizaare    the frighteners never once feels like it is running long    the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year   and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters    this movie is probably what casper would ve looked like if david lynch directed it    it s easily the best film of the year   so far    
927	0	everybody in this film s thinking of alicia    no   this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the   cryin    video    this is one of those erotic thrillers   but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed    first off   there s zero sex   almost no nudity   and it s not as well plotted as one of those tweed flicks    well   anyway    the   plot      alicia plays   well   the babysitter   who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents   j   t    walsh and lee garlington   go out to a party    the film   trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers   shows every characters  thoughts   except alicia s    the thing is alicia s in most of them in most cases   and the thoughts aren t too kosher    first off   there s her boyfriend   jeremy london   who gave one of the all time lousy performances in   mallrats     and is only a notch better here     who s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully   played by nicky katt from   suburbia     who shows he s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again      they decide they want to crash her babysitting job   looking for the typical babysitting hanky panky    somethine like that    the film intercuts between the subplots   alicia babysitting   nicky and jeremy   the party   and each characters  thoughts    we get to see jeremy and nicky s dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia   j   t    thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub   she has it all covered up   the little tease     and   worst of all   lee garlington dreaming of that hunk   george segal    it even shows them in bed together    yea    i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed   though i guess i m used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in   flirting with disaster      the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing   but come on    like we care about any of the characters    the only interesting one is alicia   mainly because she s alicia   and we mostly see her in the fantasies    so i guess she s some kind of mystery or something    but she is never explored further    so   basically   this film is just a series of mastabatory images   sometimes featuring a non nude alicia   once again   sadly     sometimes featuring a scantily clad george segal   once again   sadly      i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night   and let me tell you   it is the only way to watch this film    i mean   there s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night   they re just as good as sleeping pills    and this one is one big fat waste of time   even for an alicia film    
1194	1	in some regards   making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it    try too hard   and it snaps   but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther    in simon birch   director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique   he takes advantage of caution and poise   but also risks his movie with a few bold steps    in the end   he s not only holding an unbroken band   but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature    there s no doubt about it   the film that johnson has crafted is rich    he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown   maine   leaves turn bright orange in the fall   the grass is a lush green   pure white snow falls in the winter   and the sky goes on forever    the characters continue that turn   our two leads are simon birch   ian michael smith   and joe wenteworth   joseph mazzello      simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital   and by age twelve he s only two feet tall    joe is the bastard son of rebecca   ashley judd     and by age twelve he s ready to know who is father is    naturally   the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together   from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball    in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith   simon birch is convinced that he s god s instrument   and there must be a reason he s so small    joe doesn t quite buy it   but he sticks by simon   the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other s only true friends    early on   the two meet up with ben goodrich   oliver platt     rebecca s new boyfriend   and although the bond isn t immediate   ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other    both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability    the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon   a testament to the acting jobs of both    finally   jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day   and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show    mark steven johnson s sense of drama and writing is fantastic    the script is loosely based on john irving s novel   a prayer for owen meany   but it s so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from  based on  to  suggested by      along those same lines   it s almost unfitting to compare the two   johnson uses tension   humor   atmosphere   and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions    by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity   gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks   but the winning idea remains the same    simon birch is a different look at a different life   and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come    in the present   however   it s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at    
702	0	   the beach   is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder    every forty minutes of this two hour film begins with a new theme   virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act    it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment    but then in the second act   the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of   blue lagoon      forty minutes later   the mood changes once more   and it becomes a dumbed down version of   lord of the flies   where an isolated community is discovered   where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs    by the time it s over   you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about    the main character of   the beach   is angst ridden richard   leonardo dicaprio      he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you re looking for a good time    richard s voice over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown    this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for    he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy   robert carlisle      he seems like a raving lunatic   obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis    though his jagged behavior would distress most of us   richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen    moreover   the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life    captivated by the idea   he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey    they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise   who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard s    once they finally arrive at this paradise   however   the mood of the story shifts to richard s growing desire for francoise    this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard    etienne is about as exciting as fluffy   white sand    it s odd that etienne never sees this coming   but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view    and once the three stumble across the hidden community   mood shift imminent     more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers    for example   there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards    and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark    there are several ideas that are introduced in   the beach   and each one could merit its own feature length film    there s the man vs   nature angle   the love triangle angle   and the utopia gone awry angle    but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred    dicaprio   as a result   has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through    consequently   the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up

1018	1	carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion    made in 1972   it still features most of the regulars of this genre    sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit   kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting   head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac   hattie jacques re takes her role as matron   and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr   goode    the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs   with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard    this time   williams is after matron   jacques   when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr   goode    the doctor   hawtrey   is sworn to secrecy       i assure you   that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other      bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself    there are great cameos from joan sims   an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene   and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he s at work   at the railway station      sid james  gang including cyril his son   kenneth cope   try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home    he has to share a room with nurse ball   barbara windsor   and she soon sees through him    the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital s pills with panic ensuing    there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron   however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous  matron s     williams is   as usual   on top form   but sid james isn t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all    the same does not go for charles hawtrey   for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time   he seems to steal every scene he is in    by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor s talent to full effect   the film seems to flounder   but it certainly makes up for it with it s good storyline and it s other appealing characters    this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored    
1382	1	ok   i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start    a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents    with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure    yuck    but it s not really too bad    it has a lot working against it   for me at least    in addition to the above   it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made for tv movie   but longer and with bigger stars   and you have to pay to see it    it does win you over   though   even if it is painfully predictable    just think about it   two single parents   with their cute kids   are thrown together due to a missed field trip    through a day of near disasters   they cont inually meet   get in one another s way   cause trouble for one another   and generally insult one another at every opportunity    in fact   they hate each other so much that we know that they are   or soon will be   in love    the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples    so this film is predictable   just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable   and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman s model for this film      will they get fired from their yuppie jobs    will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids    will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex husband   a drummer for bruce springsteen   really is   aren t they all        will they finally kiss    well   what do you expect    but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled   especially when it is done with as much humour   along with a lack of sticky sentimentality   as it is in this film    pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming   and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show    one word of caution   though    this film is being billed in some places as a   family   movie    don t let that stop you    however   i think most kids   especially boys   would be pretty bored by this move    after all   nobody gets killed and there are no explosions    all in all   a good   non offensive date movie    the flying inkpot rating system     wait for the tv2 broadcast         a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha           pretty good   bring a friend             amazing   potent stuff               perfection    see it twice

believing she s a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david s quick tempered son   michael    diedre   at the same time   murders a bunch of people    comments   the ex is a very bad movie    i haven t seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while    i kept vacillating   however   between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor   ultimately   i decided to split the difference and give it two stars      as summarized briefly in the synopsis   this is yet another spurned psycho lover gets her revenge type movie    i m not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline   but it seems like 10   000   000   000    the ex   however   though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre   differs slightly from the norm in that   at least   it doesn t take itself too seriously like so many other duds do   malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind      those involved in the movie realize they re in a turkey   apparently   and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script    the ex s storyline   as i said   incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature   however   the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that   after a while   the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie    diedre   david s first wife   kills and kills and kills   for example   without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like   it s not as though she s bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime      david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael   their son   has emotional problems   specifically his inability to control his anger    though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie   the connection between him and his son is not made    molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she s a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son    time and time again   things do not add up in this movie    if a viewer can t accept this fact   then he will definately not like the ex    if   on the other hand   he can appreciate the movie for its campiness   then he ll probably like it much better    i don t mean to necessarily suggest   however   that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp    even when viewed from an it s so bad it s good angle   this movie isn t all that successful    the ex does have its moments   though   almost all of which involve yancy butler   the psychotic diedre   and nick mancuso   david      these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which   oftentimes   elicit chuckles from the audience    the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along    butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue   every time her character kills someone   she has a punchline that s unbelievably inane    when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david   for example   diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states   i m so sorry   your lease is terminated      or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene       diedre s therapist wishes to have her recommitted   so she decides to visit diedre   alone   in her new apartment    never realizing   of course   that it s not her s    therapists typically are catatonically brain dead in these movies      having successfully snuffed the woman out   diedre looks at the body and says     what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session   dr   jones    oh   that s right     i m sorry   but your time is up        this is what passes for humor in the film    the audience doesn t necessarily laugh but groan   the type of groan that suggests the audience can t believe they re watching this crap    although watching it they are      nick mancuso s chainsmoking   nervous wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler s character delivers   but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief    in between drags off his cigarette   for instance   in one of the movie s best scenes   david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex wife is    in exaggerated exasperation   he nearly shouts   the woman is a cuckoo bird         trust me   it is funny in context      and so   the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion    i won t reveal the ending specifically   though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review     but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film    molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds    molly   at one point in the film   not so brilliantly observes   after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family s to spy upon them   that   she s crazy      you d be pretty crazy too if you d rented this turkey    i d avoid it unless it s on tv and you come across it    if you do   you may want to watch it   groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot   and feel good that you didn t spend money renting it

1143	1	   very bad things     is the most delightfully morbid film of the year   a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn t help but be won over by the material    the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas    the groom to be is kyle fisher   jon favreau     who is about to be married to the controlling   wedding obsessed laura   cameron diaz      the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd   christian slater     quiet charles   leland orser     and brothers   michael   jeremy piven   and family man adam   daniel stern      after a wild night of gambling   boozing   and drugs   a stripper   carla scott   who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room   but after a freak accident   to everyone s terror   she is killed    as robert puts it     there are two options   go to the police and go to prison   or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her      after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body   robert is forced to kill him as well       okay   there is only one option now    you can forget about calling the police     he says    by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer   most of them are overcome with guilt   which sets off an even more elaborate series of event   that includes much   much more murder   double crosses   and the inevitable wedding from hell       very bad things     which is actor peter berg s feature film directing debut   is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that     there s something about mary     wanted to be    it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh   original   and hilarious   even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence   gore   and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end    the screenplay   also written by berg   is   to put it mildly   very funny and courageous    during the second act of the film   some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death   which was beginning to undermine the humor   but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed    the dialogue is edgy and inventive   and this film proves that a movie doesn t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable    there s more fun   i think   in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts    cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here   and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura   who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends    diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january    by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger   and reciting lines like     stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs     i couldn t help but crack up at how   balls to the wall   this film had become    jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original   as daniel stern s wife   who late in the picture   we discover   is a tough kick boxer that should not be messed around with    it is at this level that     very bad things     was so entertaining and surprising    just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen   there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky    the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over the top    although i enjoyed the film immensely   let me make this clear     very bad things     is not a movie for everyone    it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen   it is more violent and bloody than a r rated film usually is   and it is offensive    luckily   these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy   since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no holds barred   politically incorrect comedy    the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and   safe   wide releases coming out lately   still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry

1019	1	the ultimate match up between good and evil     the untouchables   is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry    based on the 1959 television show of the same title     the untouchables   may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place   but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences   some excellent acting   a memorable score   and a clever script    the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public    elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order    however   as ness soon learns   in order to stabilize peace   you have to bend a few laws    the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes    the film begins with capone   played perfectly by deniro   declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws    the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl    from this point we know capone is evil   not only because he kills without hesitation   but also because he is a lying bastard    right from the first five minutes of the film   de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs    this developed hatred is before the film s hero   ness   is even introduced    i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone    the film only gets better from this point    with the formation of the untouchables   there is a group of men wearing long   dark overcoats and hats    they walk in unison and they only look forward    as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens    holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals   this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films    one that comes to mind is   the matrix   when neo   morpheus   trinity   and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world    wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930 s style   the similarities between these two are countless       the untouchables   has some of the hippest   bravest heroes in any action film    the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone s army    each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others    elliot ness   played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner   is a character that surely grows during the course of the film    he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be    however   as the film develops so does ness    his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side    he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends    his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in    sean connery   who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role   plays malone   an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables    malone acts as a mentor to ness    he teaches him   the chicago way   to do things   when they attack with a knife   you attack with a gun    connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed    andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone   a young man who is just becoming a police officer    as ness grows   he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him    charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone    smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film    the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen    also very similar to   the matrix     they are exciting and intense     from a western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps   the scenes are well thought out and well executed    the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement    its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors    the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective    although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified   this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting   great directing   and great action    some scenes   capone and the baseball bat   the train station   have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid

1694	1	making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed   especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece    when it comes to living up to expectations   a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure    for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original s greatness is very rare indeed    and whereas   babe   pig in the city   misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe   it is a worthy companion piece    more than that   it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right       babe   pig in the city   warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like   the godfather   part ii   and   the empire strikes back   as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced       babe   pig in the city   picks up precisely where   babe   left off    having won the sheep herding competition   farmer hoggett   james cromwell   and his pig are elevated to fame status    a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs   hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city    in doing so   the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original       babe   pig in the city   flourishes where so many sequels fail    most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film    not   babe   pig in the city      this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first    also   by not being content to utilize most of the old characters   this film gives us many new ones to enjoy    in essence   it doesn t attempt to copy itself    instead   it strives to achieve an originality of its own    and it succeeds    that s not to say the familiar is absent       babe   pig in the city   retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film    along with babe himself   ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride   as does mrs   hoggett   one of this decade s best and most underappreciated comic characterizations   hilariously performed by magda szubanski      the three singing mice also make the journey   chiming in with their cute high pitched vocals    the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice    from there   we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne s soothingly deep narrative    composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these    but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting    while staying at the flealands hotel   babe encounters a veritable ark full of new animals    monkeys   kittens   and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new   urbanites   that babe befriends   as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter    each character is distinctly unique   some of which are imbued with personal human like struggles that are endearing and touching    and while this world focuses largely on these animals   we are introduced to two new human characters as well    mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel   an animal loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors    stein s landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature    we also meet fugly floom   an old soft spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel   utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions    not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film   it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was    so as not to ruin this well kept secret   i won t reveal the actor s identity here    it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance    the greatest triumph of   babe   pig in the city   is the art direction    simply put  it bleeds creativity   taking the look of the original film to a whole new level    restricted primarily to a farm the first time around   this second installment creates an entire city   dazzling us with unique fable like architecture    but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world s architectural landmarks    designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty   the sydney opera house   the brooklyn bridge   the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower   ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities   as seen in the film photo and pre production drawing to your right      added to that   many of this city s streets are the twin siblings of venice s gondola trekked rivers    the metropolis that has sprung from ford s vision is a wondrous sight to behold    it is a world that you want to walk around in    norma moriceau s costume designs belong in this world   vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford s landscape    most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish   with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom s clown outfit    andrew lesnie s photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film s multiple emotional tones    much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of   babe   pig in the city      reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg 13 rating    these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating    but even so   to be anything harsher than the original  s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms    by deleting a minimal number of shots     babe   pig in the city   was eventually given the coveted g rating    although appeased   many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark   fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself    well   to coin a phrase   the reports of   babe   pig in the city    s death at the hands of a dark   scary   felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated    granted it has its moments of pseudo morbidity   but all in all   babe   pig in the city   is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be    whatever   dark   moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller   the   mad max   trilogy     the witches of eastwick       lorenzo s oil        having served as a producer and co writer on the first film   miller moves into the director s chair for this one   putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise    the story of   babe   pig in the city   is an enchanting yarn   but one that doesn t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original    missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity   an individual s worth   challenging conformity   and one s purpose in life       babe   dealt with this weighty subject matter   creating a timeless fable       babe   pig in the city   should not have rehashed these themes   but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones    this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife   class differences   sacrificial courage   and so on    but this film s goals aren t as lofty as the first s   instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach   allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting   sometimes intense   fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive       babe   pig in the city   also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film   specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe    hoggett s love for babe   which grew ever so gently   is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality    best exemplified in hoggett s dance for babe   this moving relationship was truly unique    it is something that i wish would have been present again   and could have through fugly floom     but was not    please understand   these are not negative criticisms   per se    but simply statements of what i see as the differences between   babe   pig in the city   being a very good film and the original being a great one    but having said that   these observations are minor critiques at best    as an overall piece     babe   pig in the city   is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end    sure   it isn t a great film   but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness    it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor   exciting in its adventurous exploits   funny with its dry wit and cute voices   and breathtaking in its presentation       babe   pig in the city   may not be moviemaking at its absolute best   but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema    as a result   if you choose to let this film pass you by   you will be missing of the year s best cinematic treats    
8	0	so ask yourself what   8mm       eight millimeter     is really all about    is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy   sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography    is it about the business itself   how   bubbling just beneath the surface of big town americana   there s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires    or is it about those who can   those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see    i m not talking about snuff films   supposed   documentaries   of victims being brutalized and killed on camera    i m talking about films like   8mm   and its director   joel schumacher    with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit     batman   robin       a time to kill       batman forever       the client     schumacher certainly has that kind of influence    is   8mm   something you really want to see    probably not    the first two thirds of   8mm   unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama   albeit with a particularly unsavory core    then   as it s been threatening all along   the film explodes into violence    and just when you think it s finally over   schumacher tags on a ridiculous self righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further    trust me    there are better ways to waste two hours of your life    nicolas     snake eyes     cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband s safe documents a young girl s murder    welles goes about his assignment rather matter of factly   and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly   almost as if you don t need any specialized skills or training to do this    welles certainly makes it look easy    and cops   obviously   never look in toilet tanks for clues    the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes   like george c   scott in paul schrader s   hardcore      occasionally   a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector   reminding him of his unpleasant task    there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife   played by catherine keener   who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split level home in harrisburg   pa       8mm   doesn t condemn or condone its subject matter   it just exploits it    the irony   of course   is that schumacher and   seven   scribe andrew kevin walker s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r rated   first run hollywood product    so we only see snippets of snuff   and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror    later it s the turn of joaquin phoenix   who s quite good and by far the film s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california   to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again    all this to get to the familiar yet offensive   revelation   that sexual deviants are not   indeed   monsters but everyday people like you and me    neither super nor standard     8mm   is shocking only in its banality    
159	0	a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent   but one with no edge to it    it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich   s and stock characters of this genre    though it s a well written and well acted fluff piece   it still does not have too much to say that is surprising    it s made for the gentle art house set   those who don t want something too disturbing to think about    it s about a critically successful writer husband   alec   pryce     who is so self absorbed that he s threatened by his department store floor walking model wife   kate   bouquet     who wants to be a writer    she meets his crass publisher   vanni corso   walken     another self absorbed man   and a predictable relationship occurs    the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband s first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet    she now wants her own identity and her independence    the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff   and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie    the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium   and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax    it s set in london   and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper   vanni    she later meets him as her hubby s new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality   and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel    alec who is an obnoxious grouse   someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with   tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published  which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni    the publisher is proud that he s a mamma s boy who never married and is a self made man who has earned millions    he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it   as he proudly tells kate     if my father could sell pizzas in harlem   i could sell culture in europe      the only thing that couldn t be sold   is this stiff story and tired plot line    the mystery to me   is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy    she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon to become beleaguered vanni    when she writes a second novel   he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did    it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one   as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper    a business affair was loosely based on the real life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly   in their celebrated 1950s love triangle    
711	0	i can imagine how good krippendorf s tribe must have looked on paper    it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors   led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director   todd holland     all wanted to make this film    in fact   it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf s tribe as possible    in retrospect   i can imagine how bad this film could have been    i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss    dreyfuss plays james krippendorf   an anthropologist who is granted  100   000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea    halfway into his two year expedition   his wife   apparently   dies    i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established    later   we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big screen tvs and other such pleasures    so   when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely   he decides to construct an elaborate lie    he makes his own tribe   using his three children as actors in a video    he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe   which he calls the shelmickedmu      audiences at krippendorf s lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision    and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community    like all films like this   the lie becomes more and more complex   and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero    dreyfuss is a funny   talented man   and he is funny in this film    he has lots of positive energy and   unlike most comical actors   really manages to play people like this realistically    this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i ve never seen dreyfuss perform   and he does a great job    jenna elfman   who plays veronica mecilli   a scientist who wants in on krippendorf s work   is also very funny and appealing here    and the kid actors are great   as well    but we re talking about the script from hell    this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen    but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it    all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew    no   the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched    furthermore   the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless    take   for instance   the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex    they get all decked out in the tribe getup   complete with paint to darken their skin    krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe    now   i saw this scene coming from a mile away   but i said to myself     no   that would be far too tasteless    there s no way they ll do that       oh  god      they did do it    it s there    i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn t bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film    i found it deplorable    and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it   he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice    the film is filled with scenes like these    they not only insult the audience   but they insult the types of people that the film portrays    it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists   yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon    and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining   but i think that most members of the on screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes    if i were an anthropologist   this film would insult me immensely    moving right along   the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes    sure   dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny   and it allows for some entertaining scenes   but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes    it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film    his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar   and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does    i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case   but for the purposes of good taste   i would have expected something    no   this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues   and the writer of the film   charlie peters   didn t include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad    in fact   it s his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing   and he continually shrugs off her warnings    i suppose it s important to admit that this is a funny film    dreyfuss and elfman   and many of the contrived and insulting scenes   add up to a picture that is anything but boring    and if you re less serious than i   you probably will enjoy it    i   however   can t get past these elements    krippendorf s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy   but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn t be learning    with a little more insight into its story and themes   this could have been a good movie

1688	1	   the fighting sullivans   contains a major plot development in the last ten minutes that every movie guide has seen fit to give away    there was no dramatic tension for me while watching the film   as i knew exactly what was going to happen    and that s the worst thing that can happen before viewing a movie    because of this   i will tread lightly so i don t ruin it for anyone reading this review   and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it       the fighting sullivans   revolves around a family that consists of a mother   father   sister   and five brothers    the brothers are very close   despite the occasional disagreement    they are inseperable   and never stray from one another    their friendship and loyalty is the foundation of this picture    the first half of the movie follows the brothers as young children   and their various adventures    when four of them get into a fight with some local boys   the youngest sullivan   who is inside a church at the time   comes running out to assist   but not before properly exiting the chapel    if i m being awfully vague about details   it s because what i have told you is essentially the first hour and a half    all i can say is go watch this film   because it is a fine portrait of a family that sticks together   through the good and the bad    and after you see the movie   you will understand why this review has been written the way it has

1351	1	martin scorsese s kundun   which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama   has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure    personally   i don t think it needs one   it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china    scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do   as a larger than life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership   the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences   but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal    the set design and cinematography are outstanding   and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle   it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao    political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans   kundun does not   it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative    
1165	1	note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    it s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth    the lion king had just cracked  300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history   continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast    since then   though   disney s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns   with pocahontas   the hunchback of notre dame   and this year s hercules successively proving less and less potent    with the once seemingly impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable   and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox s anastasia   disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation   the little mermaid    while the animation for the film is   as is typically the case for disney films   unquestionably top notch   the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation   but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music    the film s storyline is fairly straightforward    young teen falls for handsome man   father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter   teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man    except in this case   the chaperone is a crab   the teen is a young mermaid   and the object of her desire is a human prince    what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions    from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric   she s resolutely smitten   and she s such a pure and endearing character that one can t help but invest their heart with her    this simple but touching love story   coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour   makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture    one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it   the voices cast for its motley crew of characters    this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue   which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams  much heralded turn in aladdin   by the release of the lion king and henceforth   the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities    while it s understandable that animated features lacking the name recognition or drawing power of disney   say   balto s use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda   or even anastasia s showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack   would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products   it s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy    do we really need to hear   say   demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame    is the film s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice   rather than a voice which best suits the role       i m not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan      fortunately   the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid   although perhaps more obscure   are impeccably cast    chief among them is jodi benson   a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you   who voices the film s heroine ariel to perfection   with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor   and gorgeous singing voice   ms   benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film       she s the only reason i d even consider catching flubber      similarly   samuel e   wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian   the weary guardian crab    he easily milks his lovable character s comic moments for all they re worth   and his rendering of two of the little mermaid s big tunes      under the sea   and   kiss the girl      have become the stuff of legend    pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea witch ursula   while kenneth mars  booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel s father   king triton    in large roles and small   edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal   and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef     the little mermaid is impeccably cast    of course   the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken   music   and howard ashman   lyrics     who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr   ashman s untimely death    not only are mr   menken s tunes unbearably catchy   but mr   ashman s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character s dialogue   and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film    mr   menken s score for the film is equally top notch   the sequence where eric   voiced by christopher daniel barnes   and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr   menken s fine score    it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso styled   under the sea   as joyfully crooned by mr   wright   which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song    indeed   one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune    but my favourite is ms   benson s heartfelt rendition of the ballad   part of your world     an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope   wonderfully lyricized by mr   ashman   which   accompanied by the film s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence   packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes    during the song s reprise   which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in   the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking   and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history    as of this writing   november 1997 has come to an end   as has disney s limited 17 day re release of the little mermaid    there s no question that the primary motivation for   if not the film s reissue itself   at least its timing   was to reinforce disney s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture   anastasia    in every respect   the re release of the little mermaid appears to be a success    the film s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic  100 million mark   the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video   pulling in close to  10 million in its opening weekend   and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively marketed anastasia in head to head competition   it siphoned enough from the fox film s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot   allowing for disney s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away    but although disney s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self serving and protectionist   the real winner is the public    any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one   and it s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen    the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney s modern animation renaissance   and one of the greatest animated films ever made

974	0	 bicentennial man  is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment    chris columbus   the director who gave you   mrs   doubtfire     plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point    based on the short story by isaac asimov   it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human   which as you can imagine is very difficult    starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children    soon this robot   called andrew   robin williams   shows abilities that makes his owner mr   martin   sam neill   very curious    andrew is interested in art and music   he   enjoys   making clocks   which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions    it shows out that because of a small failure in the   electrical circuits   and   positronic brain   andrew has accidentally gained a soul    this makes him unique and his evil creators worried    then mr   martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn t programmed to do    soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom   destiny and love    this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner   a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction    ever since that film   the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy    what makes us human    the thoughts    the emotions    is it possible to become human    at what point can we say to a robot   now you are one of us      these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach    it is obvious that columbus didn t take them very seriously    when you think about it   this film is not really meditating on the question   when is a robot no longer a machine   but a human being       but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding    andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being   and only the society has troubles with it    in other words   it is as far from reality as from the academy awards    further more   there are other annoying problems    to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now    this has not been done for obvious reasons   because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task    columbus is the first to have crossed that line    the result is   as you might imagine   primitive   unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort    the world is simply frozen in time    neither the society   fashion   culture or values have changed over 200 years    mom is still working at the kitchen   doing the dishes    when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today   you ll see a slightly bigger difference    i am not saying that everything should change    it is unlikely that the human rights will change   but it s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science   technology and fashion    i suppose it s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale   but it s really hard    robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way    as always he does a decent job   as does sam neill    but it doesn t really matter    it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience    pretty much like last year s   meet joe black     this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn t deserve    great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten    when isaac asimov wrote this story   the future seemed far away and magical    everything seemed possible    now is the future of asimov s time   and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago    for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne s   20 000 leagues under the sea     so can t we accept this story as a potential reality    let us hope that next year s   a   i      will be more rewarding

1055	1	earth is a harsh   unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent    people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict   as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets   indian and pakistani   muslim   hindu   sikh   parsee    the story takes place in lahore   which was indian before partition   and pakistani afterward   regardless of what its citizens might call themselves    the action is seen through the eyes of lenny   maaia sethna     a young parsee girl   but it is really about her nanny   shanta    shanta has a small circle of male admirers    two of the men are suitors   hasan   rahul khanna     a hindu   and dil navaz   aamir khan     a muslim    the others  sikh   hindu   muslim  are older   some are married   but all appreciate shanta   who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das       she also starred in deepa mehta s previous film   fire   the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water      in an early scene   the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny   political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears    one of the men remarks   jokingly   that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along    he is wrong   the men make barbed little comments to each other   spoken like jokes   but with an undercurrent of fanaticism    the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses    it is easy to perceive   in these squabbles   the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter    the group around shanta represents   in a sense   a united india   and shanta herself the ideal motherland  one which all love   which inspires hindu   muslim   and sikh to live peacably together    but the circle around shanta is sundered   as is the state    a sikh is persecuted   hides   then flees    another man is murdered    the group of friends will not meet again    the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction   a plate shattered on the floor   a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child   and   most brutally   when the tension escalates into violence   a man is held down   tied between two cars   and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles    it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully    the crux of earth s plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz    his sisters are killed in brutal fashion   by hindus   because they are muslim    dil navaz seeks solace from shanta   and asks in desperation that she marry him    but she loves hasan   and tenderly refuses dil navaz s offer    the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him   and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality   the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate    despite the things he later does   it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him   but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things    the conclusion  the consequence of dil navaz s transformation  is rather abrupt    the story earth tells does not end    it just stops    it is an appropriate finish   giving us closure would have imparted   at least on an aesthetic level   a sense of resolution   of satisfaction    but there was no resolution for india and pakistan  they have been at war   on a small or large scale   for decades    since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation   it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus    there is no healing to be had   no closure   on any level   despite the needless   tacked on ending   with voice over narration from lenny as an adult   framing the story      earth is   in some ways   an unexceptional movie    it does not reinvent the wheel   following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas    but deepa mehta s directon is assured   and the issues she addresses run deep    earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou s to live and tian zhuangzhuang s the blue kite did for china   they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history    such films strike me as inherently valuable   even when flawed    they may be biased or inaccurate   but they bear the weight of human hardship   and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other   more inventive films   often lack    it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries   the events shown may have happened decades ago   but they still touch a nerve    the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year    in the near future   india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other    at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen   after seeing earth   i have a much   much better understanding    
140	0	my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love    i love ralph fiennes    i love uma thurman    i love sean connery    hell   i m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw    i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago   and i ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since    a few months into the summer   however   i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times   and that it had ended up in the mid august dumping ground    then   in this final week before its official release   i learned that it was not to be screened for critics    and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs    and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique    my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things    the film i saw today didn t even meet those expectations    this is a lousy   incoherent mess    i would slam it harder   if it weren t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine   lovable actors    but sets are ultimately empty   and the performances are completely uninspired    that s the main problem with the avengers   for all it s hip hop flash and tidal waves   none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired    it s like a chore   a bland exercise in superhero film making    it also feels like its been cut to pieces   clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots    this is just plain depressing    the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show    frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i ve never watched an episode    i wasn t alive then    i don t even watch television now    i m very sorry that i don t have this perspective   but   judging from the reviews i ve already read   knowing the tv show just makes matters worse    i didn t know and love john steed and emma peel   and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles    i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film    based on what the film told me   i gather that steed   fiennes   is some kind of british super guy   somewhat like james bond     and that dr   peel   thurman   is just a really smart doctor   who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits    they are to work together   under mother s orders   mother is played by jolly jim broadbent   while his co conspirator   father   is played by the equally talented fiona shaw      it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather    his name is de wynter   connery      he is a crazy scottish guy    our heroes had better stop him   or else            the weather will keep getting colder until they   have to go to hell to warm up     one of the film s few funny lines      along the way there is subplot after subplot   hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere   feel perfunctory   and ultimately make no sense    for example   our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos    now   killer bugs don t really go with the weather controlling theme of the film    the purpose of the bugs   other than to annihilate our heroes   is never established    they re never even directly connected to de wynter   they re controlled by his crazy henchman   played by eddie izzard      the special effects aren t bad   but they re loud   obnoxious   and intrusive    like so many scenes in the film   it seems present only to keep your attention from waning    and i guarantee you   it will wane    i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn t do any good to think    the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn t tell us what happens    there are several scenes in the preview that didn t make the final cut    in addition   many of the sequences have irritating   grainy film quality   which makes it feel low budget   the last scene is particularly bad      the scenes that don t feature action should be electric   thanks to our wonderful cast    they aren t    the action scenes should be electric   because this is an action film    they aren t   either    and what about this wasted cast    oh   it makes me weep with disappointment    we re talking ralph fiennes here   one of the best actors working today   one of the best actors   ever      i love the guy    i ve loved all his films   until this one    he seems like he wants to understand the film   but he s as lost as we are    and thurman   in all of her spectacular beauty and talent   can t manage to look at home here       i don t blame her completely   for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way   and it can t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting      connery   however   seems the most out of it   totally lacking any kind of focus   or interest   for that matter    who is to blame    is it the screenwriter   don macpherson    perhaps   although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right    is it the actors    for god s sake   no    these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling    i blame director jeremiah chechik   who shouldn t have been given the task to begin with    his best film   benny   joon   is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be   but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor    add to that a lack of experience in big budget action   and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory    if the avengers has a saving grace   it s the set design    the sets   by stuart craig   are big   colorful   and often pleasing to look at    i like the final set piece   on de wynter s island   even if none of it makes a bit of sense    i admired the overhead view of the stairs   showing dr   peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere    i also enjoyed michael kamen s music score   particularly in the opening credits    but this stuff is routine    good sets and music are nice   but there s a lot more that needs to be here    inspiration   for instance   would have been really nice    maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story    or a sense of purpose    most of all   though   i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles    damn this movie for not giving them the chance

cash in by informing his old mob boss   kevin pollak   about jimmy s whereabouts   but in the process   he falls in love with jimmy s wife   cynthia   natasha henstridge     who is being held hostage    upon return to quebec   and with one contrivance after the next   oz s dental assistant   jill   amanda peet     is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside   the tulip     and forces him to set up a meeting   since jill s dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself    have you got all that    because there is more    much   much more    and this is a movie that   without credits   is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour       the whole nine yards   is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty headed excursion into well worn terrain already set by far superior pictures    how the cast   most of which are respectable actors   got caught up in such a cliched   deficient film remains a mystery   unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn s 1985 comedy classic     clue   the movie      going into the theater   preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable   but by the twenty minute mark   when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time   it was clear this production was in serious trouble    since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot   and the screenplay   inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner   collapses with every failing   comedy   bit   the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and   frequently   entertainment value       the whole nine yards   is neither facetious nor   aside from the subplot about jill s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman   inventive   and more often than not   just lies there   the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector   but never igniting any sort of spark    a few select actors do what they can with the material   while others make no impact at all    on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters   matthew perry and bruce willis    perry   innocuously enjoyable on tv s   friends     plays the same exact sitcom style character in all of his movies   from 1997 s   fools rush in   to 1999 s   three to tango       and it has become a crushing bore    meanwhile   willis makes next to no impression   and because of the limited guise of his jimmy   the tulip   tudeski   oftentimes disappears into the background    their three female counterparts fare noticeably better    best of all is natasha henstridge   far more radiant than in the exploitative   species   movies   who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia    henstridge has the talent   for sure   to break out of these countless throwaway roles   but first she must fire her agent    amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill   and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who   thus far   has strived on a career based solely on comedy    it is too bad   then   that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene   with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts    finally   rosanna arquette is awful as sophie   but something tells me that was her purpose   and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time    also popping up is michael clarke duncan   fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in   the green mile     as jimmy s largely built friend and fellow killer   frankie figs    when   the whole nine yards   eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion   one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit    a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past   and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films   so what was the point    without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments     the whole nine yards   rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast   and half of the actors are not charming at all    now   what does that tell you    
396	0	actually   i m fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie       baywatch   babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double d s on the small screen    at least there you don t have to pay to see her cleavage    and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless   hate to burst your bubble   but there are no full fledged nude scenes in barb wire    you wouldn t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in    i can t go back in time and reverse my mistake   but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there    they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude   it s so quick you can t even tell for sure whether you re seeing her andersons or not    a nipple hallucination sort of thing    barb wire was adapted from a comic book   interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life   even wearing low cut leather to do office work   businesswoman bondage wear   and having unreal body proportions    yes   like the mona lisa   pamela anderson is a man made beauty   probably in more senses than one    she is a definite beauty   though   and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience    you d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie   because it s obvious she wasn t pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills    i mean   she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler s convention    the movie is set in the year 2017     the worst year of my life     pam says         the worst movie of the year     i say      america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation   silicone valley   i think      she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right   posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute    but don t call her   babe      she hates that   and reminds us of that fact way too many times    imagine   a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist   demeaning term    a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn t have to hear words like   babe   during a strip tease   especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success    the plot   ha ha   revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate s retina scanners    in the words of one of the characters   they re   more than meets the eye      reminds me of the   transformers   cartoon   and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent   but that never happened    no   the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van damme   big busted kickboxer   and her resistance accomplices   ex boyfriend axel   tamuera morrison   and cora   victoria rowell      thank god they didn t name her cora reef    one bad character name is more than enough    pamela originally doesn t take sides   giving some speech about she s only loyal to the money they pay her   but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother   jack noseworthy of bon jovi   always   video fame    i still don t know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy   but he definitely is nose worthy   even if he isn t sponge worthy      pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest    it s not rambo        it s bimbo    mark my words   barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year    it s got all the elements of the direct to video releases featured on hbo s bastard cousin   the cable channel i d never watch if it didn t somehow come free    it s got the non titillating scenes of voyeurism   laughable flashbacks   bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo    there s even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie s premise while the words scroll up the screen    someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain t star wars    if you ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years   you ll recognize plenty of lifted elements    barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over   car crashes   explosions   broken glass and slow motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death    this is one of those automatic pilot movies anyone could write or direct    barb wire has only two things going for it        and i think you know what those two things are    
125	0	you don t need to have seen the original   species   to appreciate how utterly lousy   species ii   is    with few exceptions   sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them   but the fact that   species ii   is a follow up isn t the only reason it s so miserable    it s the predictable storyline   the cardboard characters   the banal dialogue   the failed attempts at humor   the revolting special effects   the gratuitous nudity   all female   of course     the bad acting   and the bland direction    the plot   simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc   involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle    the slime   well   sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black    that should have been the end of the movie right there    back on terra firma   at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and   as you ll remember if you saw the first movie   driven by a strong urge to procreate    on a parallel track   government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film   now called eve   again   played   by natasha henstridge   and are keeping her around for some testing    this   apparently   includes observing eve s reaction to   the dukes of hazzard   tv show   which she appears to enjoy    eve s bio rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk   mates     which we are forced to witness in gross out detail   but otherwise there doesn t appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film   unless it was written into her contract   let s hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only      eve finally breaks free of her confines  and her bra  for the finale   but the effects are so messy you can t really see what s going on    peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams   i told  em not to go      at the top of his lungs   referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle    michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox   so that he can enter high security areas   flash a badge and claim to be press   maybe       as does marg helgenberger as dr   laura baker   the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns    they re both unbelievably wooden    what s a talented filmmaker like peter medak     the ruling class       the krays       let him have it     doing directing this tripe   i wonder    it s an unfortunate trend   this   once talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like   species ii      last year peter hyams gave us   the relic     no thanks necessary there    and the first   species   was helmed by roger donaldson who   although certainly no genius behind the camera   had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects    is it just that there are no better offers out there       species ii   is worthless    worse than that   it s also exploitative   offensive   and insulting to the intelligence at every turn    it s not that there isn t anything positive to say about the film    there is    after 92 minutes   it ends    
554	0	this review contains spoilers   but believe me   i don t say anything you can t guess 10 minutes into the movie    i   did   go into this one with high expectations    i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks    i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining    i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film    boy   was i wrong    another garbage slasher flick   the only difference being that   this   one has a story    the story   you ask    well   a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk    he takes it home   somehow getting it past customs       and starts fiddling with it in his attic    lo and behold   after he takes it apart   three demons appear and start taking him apart   but with meat hooks    when they re finished   his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling    they botch up their cleanup job   however   and manage to leave his heart   or some gland   i didn t really recognize the organ   under a floorboard    the guy s brother and his brother s wife appear at the door soon after   and decide to move in    they throw away scumball s belongings   and set up house    turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho   and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage    she starts having some wild hallucinations    later   hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards   slow mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground  all from the tiny cut on his hand      said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball s organ    the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing    it establishes mind contact with wife   who agrees to help him get more blood   because she really wants to be screwed again    so   she helps him kill three businessmen    scumball   at this time   gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back    problem is   he doesn t have any skin   and even after three or four corpses   still doesn t get any skin    he finally gets some   though   but strangely enough   he ends up looking like his brother    guess they couldn t get the original actor back    who knows    scumball   whose name is frank   is not a nice guy    he describes his torture by the demons fondly   as the   ultimate pleasure and pain   since at that level there is no difference between the two      somehow   i don t see getting torn apart by 90 fish  and meat hooks a lot of fun    this guy is   so   bad     how bad   is   he             so   bad that the   rats   cower in a corner in fear    for good reason   too   he crucifies two of them for fun   and carves a third while the nympho s horsing around with hubby    anyway   hubby s daughter   who   if course   is not   wife s   daughter   starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams    the dumb bimbo meets scumball   and is not impressed    she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle   and brings out the demons    at any rate   the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup   they re normally quite meticulous about that type of thing    the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake    the demons are not   however   the good guys    the dumb bimbo s the good guy    she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank   but also banishes them to hell or oblivion   we re not too sure which    not too shabby for someone with single digit iq    this is basically a   bad jinn   story    it is an   awful   movie    awful acting   bad focus in the photography   many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks   which is really unrealistic   and looks like the latex that it is    continuity    who cares    acting       terrible      script    horrible    sounds canned    unrealistic    story is so so   but the impact is lost long   long before the film ends    i do think the   rat   acting was quite good    i have never seen rats look afraid    they should get nominated for an award    really good acting there   the best in the movie       the envelope for best furry rodent   please          a     rating would be far too generous    a   1 10   rating   or  4 in the  4 to  4 rating system   is far more accurate    this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing   chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog    i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show    people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen    had to have something to do    dumb   dumb   dumb movie    i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it    it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself    lots of slime and red dyed corn syrup does not constitute   horror     in my opinion    
168	0	there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space   it s just that none of them happen to be actors    the stars i m referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie s   outer space     the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home    yes   in terms of acting   the star power is            well   more like a falling star    kinda pretty   short lived   and pretty much dead    lost in space   as if you really didn t know   is based on the 60 s sci fi television series of the same name    it s the year 2058   and earth s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population    john robinson   william hurt   is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet    earth s entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission   but nobody   whether it be john s family or hired battle pilot don west   matt leblanc     seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years    john s family consists of his wife maureen   mimi rogers     his atypical teenage daughter penny   lacey chabert     his ingenious son will   jack johnson     and his beautiful scientist daughter judy   heather graham      despite everyone s reluctance   the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space    unknown to anyone but the audience   there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission    dr   smith   gary oldman   has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour   and dr   smith has re programmed a talking robot to   destroy robinson family      when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides   the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination   and now the premise of being lost in space is complete    as for the audience   you will likely be lost in boredom by this point   wondering if the plot   like the jupiter 2   will ever get off the ground    it s hard to tell who deserves the most blame   the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script    chabert is basically the only one to overdo it   sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium    if you   like me   were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens   you re wrong    that s just her normal voice    in yet another example of a   friend   faltering on the big screen   leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming   make sense       it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod    graham is a babe   thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film    hurt   the black hole of excitement   sucks up any energy that might have been left    if hurt were available in tablet form   he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill    johnson isn t dull   he s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody s ass all the time    want an example of how cool this kid can be    how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family    hey   don t laugh   the thing actually listened to the mr   rogers would be proud sentiment    but alas   if you thought a character couldn t be much worse   there was rogers as the epitome of generic   or   mother as she was known      why hire an actress    they could ve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it    now that would ve had some pizzazz    lost in space luckily doesn t suffer in every single category that it could have    the special effects are crisp   clear   and at least mildly captivating   unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman   who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse    unfortunately   oldman is locked away for most of the film   giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy    while the special effects are pleasing to the eye   they are nothing you couldn t find in most modern sci fi films    contact   for example   far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination    lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art   with numerous contradictions   the time travel aspect was horribly flawed       wooden and corny acting   worse dialogue   and an ending so disappointing   you d be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens    then again   with an ending like this film has   it s obvious a sequel is already being considered    what an awful note to end on   knowing there could be more of this in a year or two    the attempt to be family oriented is commendable   but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups    well   danger potential movie goers    danger    this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity

2000	1	steven spielberg s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film    spielberg   ever the student on film   has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest   and most powerful entries    he also managed to cast this era s greatest answer to jimmy stewart   tom hanks   who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle    for about 160 out of its 170 minutes     saving private ryan   is flawless    literally    the plot is simple enough    after the epic d day invasion   whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular     capt   john miller   hanks   and his team are forced to search for a pvt    james ryan   damon     whose brothers have all died in battle    once they find him   they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home    accompanying miller are his crew   played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational    barry pepper   adam goldberg   vin diesel   giovanni ribisi   davies   and burns are the team sent to find one man   and bring him home    the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary    literally    there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film s first 20 minutes    spielberg films almost the entire movie without music   leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion   and they do to perfection    the sequences in france   all of them   beginning with the battle and ending with the battle   are fabulous   especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides   trying to save private ryan    there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences    this is what coppola was looking for in   apocalypse now     but couldn t create    the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war    the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary    he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world   with his comic timing   dramatic flair   his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears    hanks is this country s finest actor   and he proves it here    however   spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece    with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time   spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film    the sequence involving army chief of stafff george marshall and mrs   ryan is decent   but doesn t hold up to the rest of the film   relying on wartime cliches to power it    but that is forgivable    what isn t is the bookends of the film   the cemetary sequences    the first one is quite good   a decent introduction into the lives of these men    the last sequence is atrocious    the forced emotion   accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music   is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film    these flaws are what downgrade   ryan   from the greatest film of our era   to the greatest war film of our era    spielberg should have trusted his own material   and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie   to end his masterpiece right there    the use of the flag   though patriotic   is in contrast to the movie s theme    the power of the bulk of the film   however   is astonishing    spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art   that persists even after first viewing of the film   is extraordinary    this is the film of the year    
35	0	i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film    i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying     it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday   and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach    throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof    we ll have a hit on our hands      the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film   a mishmash collage of one dimensional characters   rampant stereotypes of cultures and races   cliched emotional statements of purpose   and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography    the story is loosely based around the pro football players  strike in 1987 and a rag tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels    keanu reeves stars as shane falco   a has been football college player looking for redemption    gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers    rounding out the cast includes swingers  jon favreau   7 up pitchman orlando jones   gruff owner jack warden   and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters   the drunken welshman   the overweight sumo wrestler   the black convict   the violent cop   and the dumb   dumb cheerleaders    this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays   gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is   keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field   and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny s    the usual things happen like clockwork    the hero rises from the ashes of failure   the team comes together in unity   the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest   the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap   and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax    it s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks    howard deutch   who was behind the camera for two of the best films of  80s   pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful   has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes    obviously the problem is that without a good script   any director will fail in the end    sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory   gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds   the rise and fall of gallant heroes   and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life    the replacements offers none of this    
1675	1	in 1987 the stock market crashed   and oliver stone s wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses    wall street lucked out in its timing   the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had   and though its kill or be killed approach to business was exaggerated   that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan era businessman    stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs   evil tale relayed in the fast paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange    critics and audiences lauded wall street   elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic    i m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them    i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone s output with its thin caricatures   obvious sentiments   and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen    stone goes for broke in every scene   the same could be said for nearly all of his works      this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions    he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane    it s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity   rather than explore what these situations are really like    i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative   as they are presented in boiler room   rather than laughably over the top    these guys are salesmen after all   not televised judges    more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street    the only possible solution i can muster is its release date    and not just the timeliness of the   greed is good   subject matter   the film was plumped down in the eighties   a decade in which the one joke comedy rose to an art form   and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept   low result movies    in my mind   the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies   but bad music   bad hair   and bad clothes    maybe stone s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace    boiler room is an equally well timed film with some similarities to stone s piece of crap    they both feature a consequential father son relationship   though boiler room s is much more subtle and touching    and they are both concerned with the power of greed   yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery smooth   heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street    boiler room is a message movie as well   though   at least until the end   doesn t shove it in our faces    boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash    as i said   this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day   bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn t been seen in quite a while     not only do we want to be millionaires   we want to watch other people become millionaires    in our super judgmental   power oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything   when you have money   you have it   all      and seth   giovanni ribisi   wants it   all   the easy way    he s a well intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm   the kind that sells junk stock   whereupon he meets others just like him    ben affleck is cast as jim   the company headhunter   who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko    his job is to influence trainee s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood    it s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b   s that they re told to dish out to prospective buyers    affleck s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin s similar character in glengary glen ross   and that proves detrimental to the actor s performance    affleck shouts   curses and be littles his rookie employees just like baldwin   minus the edge    when alec played the scene he became the part   spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own    by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading    the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks   they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game    rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are   intellectual gangsters    they aren t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes    we drink up this world along with seth   and watch him become seduced by it   just like we might be    as in all cautionary tales   boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing   then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness    i know this story    we all do    but it can work if it s told with intelligence and energy   and that is how writer   director ben younger tells it    as a director of   please excuse my french   mise en scene younger has much to learn    his style is sitcom bland    but his writing isn t    younger s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch   his dialogue is like a junior david mamet    despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script    the brokers   hucksters counter every customer objection   gently bullying them into buying stock    these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes   a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn t aware that he is one    with the exception of affleck s brief appearances   the performances are truly exceptional    ribisi   who has the edgy looks of a character actor   is extremely potent here   working his pale angular face   and eerie   plaintive stare for all their worth    he conveys child like vulnerability   his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren t going his way   in some scenes   and in others he s ferociously cut throat    the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie   ribisi is confident when it s just him and the phone   but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father   authoritatively played by ron rifkin      boiler room thankfully avoids wall street like histrionics in the sales pitch sequences   the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys    those ploys are taught to seth by chris   vin diesel     a kind broker who alternates between seth s friend and his mentor    diesl shines in his minor role    this week i saw the sci fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner    in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80 s   and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70 s    nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can t have    nia long   as the firm s secretary     a lone black women amongst many white men   is ribisi s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets   but develops into something more interesting    the two make an oddly likeable couple    long is smart and brash   and ribisi is charmingly aloof    at one point he says to her   i m just lookin  for some chocolate love      it s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child like way   it becomes sweetly endearing    unfortunately   towards the end   the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy    there is much crying   hugging   and sorrowful stares    this is okay when taken in small doses   but younger s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo hoo moments   one following the other    a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth s manipulations have on one of his poor victims    it s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking   with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message    that message being     greed is bad      yes it s patently obvious   but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven t seen much of in the movies   the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur    and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners    boiler room offers neither extreme    it gives us what is in between   and for that i am thankful    
307	0	walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox s anastasia    but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios   the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about    disney s recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas   the hunchback of notre dame   and to a lesser extent   hercules    with anastasia   fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window    some may say   so what    it s just a kid s movie    well        if you have young kids   beware   as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse rotting rasputin zombie   whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way    consider yourselves warned    nevertheless   the animation is quite stunning at times    don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout   occasionally rivalling photographic quality    and yet in other scenes   the hand drawn material seems of the saturday morning tv crowd   which leads me to wonder        was this rushed to market to combat disney    the plot   as anyone who had read history before knows   concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916    not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened    as for the plot     go rent disney s candleshoe    you ll see 60  of anastasia there    
341	0	inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price    directed by william malone    starring geoffrey rush   famke janssen   and chris kattan    rated r   contains violence   profanity   and brief nudity      synopsis   eccentric millionaire price offers  1   000   000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium    the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment   an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients    comments   house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price    in an obvious homage   the millionaire s name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have    this is a pretty bad horror film   yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining   and house on haunted hill is just such a film    it is   surprisingly   better than another recent haunted house remake   the haunting   a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson    the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face    house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it s a crappy horror movie    thus   somehow   it proves slightly more successful    i can t think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast    it is this cast which lifts this ho hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror    price   the main character   is played by geoffrey rush   the academy award winning actor of shine    rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry   a spiral reminiscent of ben   ghandi   schindler s list   kingsley s ridiculous appearance in the camp sci fi classic species    i don t know why   but sometimes it s entertaining to see   quality   actors in bad movies    more surprises    rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure   rather lamely too     and singer lisa loeb        appears as a tv news reporter    the highlight of the cast   however   has to be saturday night live member chris kattan    kattan s comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium    while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what s exactly going on   the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense    a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too    house on haunted hill   i suspect   has just about left the second run theaters    it s worth catching on cable next year   if you get a chance    if you have a choice   pick this movie over the haunting   it s the better of two evils   you could say    though   more appropriately perhaps   it d be better to say that it s the better of two turkeys    
1683	1	capsule   bleak and point blank    just the way it should be    makes its case with cold blooded precision and intelligence       serial killer chic   is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary   and one of the more stomach turning ones    i ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers   and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry    i wasn t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero antihero    thankfully   that s not the way henry works    the director   john mcnaughton   took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work    it doesn t provide cheap jack explanations for henry s behavior   it shows him up for what he is   an unrepentant and un idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him    at the film s opening   henry s friend ottis toole has a sister   who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago    in a viciously riveting scene   he admits matter of factly to having murdered his own mother   and she covers his hand with hers    they are damned together from that moment on    henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun    the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it   there s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv    the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words   and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron    no preface    it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker    in a scene which many damned the movie for   unseen   they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household   playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment    the movie itself   however   does not glorify the killings   but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work   only irritation    henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting    michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame   just standing there   and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well    the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton   but he decided to give them something more memorable   and consequently the film nearly didn t see release    the film does not glorify or justify    it just shows us   with unflinching coldness   what henry was    i m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of   victim   or   hero      then again   probably   so would henry

550	0	the general s daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we ll see this year    or perhaps the stupidest clever film    it s confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction    that   however   is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller    the punched up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general s daughter has a brain in its head   even as the remaining 75  of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense    our hero is warrant officer paul brenner   a brash investigator for the u   s   army s criminal investigation division    his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell   leslie stefanson   at a georgia base   the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation    complicating the case is the fact that capt   campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell   james cromwell     a war hero and potential vice presidential nominee    general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press   which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in    teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill   madeleine stowe      who   coincidentally enough   once had a romantic relationship with brenner    brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain s past that make the case ever more sordid    if only the sordidness were the worst of the general s daughter s problems    scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary   their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered light sleaze    director simon west likely thinks he s covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers   but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches   which is the film s fatal flaw    it s a trend he continues for two hours   taking the story s few virtues and slapping a coat of moron proof obviousness over them    characters who may   wink wink   turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow   cutaway inserts of the captain campbell s still living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five minute attention spans    west just can t help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general s daughter    he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow fade edits    bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell    the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell s mentor   a psychological warfare expert named moore   james woods      there s something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another    indeed   travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures   to the local sheriff of the georgia county     shouldn t you be out night sticking the colored folk          even the lame device of brenner and sunhill s sexual history provides a few winning zingers    goldman s dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you ll find in most so called comedies    dialogue   unfortunately   just isn t enough to make a quality script    it s difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner   an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene   and too lucky for it to last any longer   not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye      by the time the general s daughter wanders towards its over wrought   psycho in the rain finale   west s heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun    it s silly and pretentious film making   but at least it provides a giggle or five    goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand up routine

1439	1	david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head    it is one of many science fiction films   released during the last year of this millenium   that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future    the story unfolds in a near future   where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs    the world of the future is an unfriendly place   where the scared inhabitants are   hiding   in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world    allegra geller   jennifer jason leigh     the leading game designer in the world   is testing her new virtual reality game   existenz with a focus group    as they begin   she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun    she flees with a young marketing trainee   ted pikul   jude law     who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard    unfortunately   her pod   an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program   is damaged    to inspect it   she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her    the events leading up to this   and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn t exist   as the   players   are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot    here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game s perspective    i don t intend to reveal more of the film s premise   which is structured as a computer game   with   tasks   that the characters must complete to win the game    released after   the matrix   and   dark city       existenz   has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films    however     existenz   is moving in a different direction   with a premise of its own    a combination of dazzling special effects   brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot   made   the matrix   a rare and entertaining science fiction experience   with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade       existenz   has a completely different atmosphere   resembling   dark city     which is darker   more serious and less entertaining       existenz   has the opportunities and potential   but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored    after the engaging beginning   it starts to falter    while i was watching the film   many left the theatre during the first hour    and indeed     existenz   seemed as a complete failure   the actors seemed unreal   the plot and dialogue silly   unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another    but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level   explaining all past events   the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes    and jet the film fails on several issues    probably the best written character in the story is a game designer   who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world   than face real life    this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character   and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg s script to the limits   but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown    existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies    it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for    it s a cold   dark place where the   players   are forced to interrelate with unreal characters   eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will    it doesn t look like a place worth even thinking about    david cronenberg has been the creator of   the fly       videodrome   and   the dead zone     so it s not so hard to guess that   existenz   is a violent and gory film    besides the regular murders of innocent people   the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two headed mutated amfibium    scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures    the way i see it   this is the film s crucial failure    it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time   space and problems of our everyday life do not exist   a place of blooming blossoms   green forests and clear waters   a place really worth sacrificing your life for    because of its lack of three dimensionality   the film looses most of its possibilities   but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes   amusing performances   especially by willem dafoe   and one interesting and important thought   depicted in many different ways throughout the movie    during the film   the audience is as confused as the characters   detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created       the matrix     despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts   ends with a light at the end of the tunnel       existenz   does not    it is a one time experience   ending in blood   gore and madness   a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow

military weapon        i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film    there s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good    in this respect   the film never disappointed me    this film reaches a level that transcends the   so bad it s good   level and borders on the downright insane    the effects are awful   the script is contrived   and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously   i think      i challenge anyone to sit through the scene   where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner   with a straight face    thankfully   the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with    dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in   johnny mnemonic   dragonheart   and starship troopers        the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit     and this one is no exception    while one never really gets the impression that meyer s character could be a bat expert in reality   one never really cares to doubt it either    she gives as good a performance as could be expected   plus she s nice to look at for an hour and a half    lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here   as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero    although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what s going on in town   for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats    the only bad performance in the film is that of leon s    he is relegated to the   i m not sticking around here      character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays    anyone who can t immediately tell that bob gunton   the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films   is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised   but i highly doubt it    even if he hadn t been the villain in just about every film he s ever been in   so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever    in fact   his death is welcome   because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale    if the plot doesn t sound ridiculous to you yet   then check out these little tidbits   a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol    an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated   causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force   killing several townsfolk    a government official blows off shelia s instructions   to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats  cave that will kill all of them off   by pulling a night job   resulting in the death of an entire military unit    a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it    finally   to top it all off   this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it s single screen theater   for reference   our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens   and we re lucky to even get kevin smith s dogma      the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill conceived bat puppets    while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing   making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what s going on     the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low key    therefore we the audience get loving close ups of the most unrealistic   rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film    being able to see the puppeteer s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse    after all of this   if you still decide bats might be the movie for you   don t say you haven t been warned    trust me when i say that it s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through    i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in    she s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these    
323	0	studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring   cliched individual   not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio   which they did according to this film    are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly   that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it       54   belongs in the elite group of films known as   the big disappointments     the films that attain so much hype and or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished    i was heavily awaiting   54     not the least because i ve become fascinated with the infamous club   which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that s been running all summer on vh1   which is   weirdly enough   much more intriguing and engrossing than this   edgy   film    perhaps more importantly     54   is part of the blossoming subgenre     the 70s nostalgia film     which has been picking up mighty steam   what with   boogie nights   and   the last days of disco   coming out within the year   and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period   the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period     but brought us interesting and real characters   like scotty   the tragically gay boom mike operator from   boogie nights     and charlotte   the ironically clueless and bitchy co protagonist from   the last days of disco     not to mention several others       54   deals not so much with the timeline of the studio   how it began   how it was run   how it ended     that s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale   but more interested in the characters who populated it    this is a definite plus    here s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party   and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases   economy problems   and perhaps worst of all   reagan   all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening    the story of the studio is tragedy in itself   let s look at how it all affected the people    but this film doesn t let that happen    it gives us a half assed protagonist named shane o shea   ryan phillippe   from   i know what you did last summer       who s chief character trait is the fact that he s from new jersey   which also happens to be his chief character flaw   i guess      he s dim witted   into being part of   the scene     and soon finds he s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars       a  bit like   saturday night fever      cept no travolta and no real interest put into him    poor   poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting   but all he is a half assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been    shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club   like anita   salma hayek     a wannabe donna sommers   and her young hubby   greg randanzo   breckin meyer   from   clueless       who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame    although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster   sela ward     an exec of sorts   he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black   neve campbell     and thus the boring romance subplot that s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film    the film s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all too necesary personage of steve rubell   played by mike myers   you heard me      rubell   the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever   and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation   but the film   thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers   makes him out to be more than that    notice the scenes sole shocking scene   where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion   myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene   and a couple others   that some of us who ve only seen him on tv never saw   and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails    first time feature director mark christopher proves that he s a better director than a writer   though not too terribly much    his story is trite and shallow   as are his characters   and his direction is shockingly flat   especially for a film about this subject    it s as if he had a great story to tell   but instead opted for the easier route    the studio s recreation is amazingly accurate   though   and very impressive   but his direction is never captivating enough    some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in   despite the film s tone   i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini s   la dolce vita       and when i watched   54     i didn t particularly want to stay    
1578	1	as fairy tales go   cinderella has to be one of the most famous    almost everyone knows it   well at least in north america    so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it    it has been done before with varying results    this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time    the basic story remains unchanged but   one thing that seems to vanish with this version   and that is all the fantastical elements of the story    there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature    after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least        unlike in the fairy tale   the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end    the   prince    who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france   meets  cinderella    known as danielle   on a few occasions   most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her    although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling      the story takes place in a renaissance setting   in france   with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion    this addition of leonardo da vinci   was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie   since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical    for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired    for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle   a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that    especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne    the characters of danielle   cinderella   played by drew barrymore   and that of the evil step mother   played by anjelica huston   are well developed and well played by the two women    although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable    the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie    as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique    but   anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly    the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella   but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable    the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise    all in all this movie takes you back into history   into a seemingly magical fairy land    but   don t get me wrong there is nothing but reality   it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening    so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not   and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing
